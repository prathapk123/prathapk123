						Landau might have been a superstar but for a role he didn?t play - the pointy-eared starship Enterprise science officer, Mr. Spock. Star Trek creator Gene Rodenberry had offered him the half-Vulcan, half-human who attempts to rid his life of all emotion. Landau turned it down.?A character without emotions would have driven me crazy; I would have had to be lobotomized,? he explained in 2001. Instead, he chose Mission: Impossible, and Leonard Nimoy went on to everlasting fame as Spock.Ironically, Nimoy replaced Landau on Mission: Impossible.After a brief but impressive Broadway career, Landau had made an auspicious film debut in the late 1950s, playing a soldier in Pork Chop Hill and a villain in the Alfred Hitchcock classic North By Northwest.He enjoyed far less success after Mission: Impossible, however, finding he had been typecast as Rollin Hand, the top-secret mission team?s disguise wizard.

The fault occurred between late 2014 until early last year.The case, set to go to trial in mid-December, accuses Apple of wrongly telling customers they were not entitled to free replacements or repair if they had taken their devices to an unauthorised third-party repairer.That advice was allegedly given even where the repair ? a screen replacement, for example ? was not related to the fault.Apple has so far chosen to remain silent about the case brought by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). But court documents obtained by Guardian Australia show the company has denied the ACCC?s allegations, saying it did not mislead or cause any harm to its Australian customers.The documents also show how the ACCC used undercover methods to investigate Apple. Investigators, posing as iPhone customers, called all 13 Apple retailers across Australia in June last year.They told Apple staff their iPhone speakers had stopped working after screens were replaced by a third party.Apple?s response was the same in each of the 13 calls, the ACCC alleges.?In each call, Apple Australia represented to the ACCC caller that no Apple entity ... was required to, or would, remedy the defective speaker at no cost under the [Australian consumer law] if the screen of the iPhone had been replaced by someone other than Apple Australia or an Apple-authorised service provider,? the ACCC?s court claim alleged. Error 53 generally occurred after a user tried to update their phone to iOS 8 or iOS 9, and affected about one in every 1,000 phones supplied by Apple or its resellers between September 2014 and February 2016. Australian consumer law clearly protects the right of a customer to a replacement or free repair if the product is faulty or of unacceptable quality. The ACCC has also alleged information on Apple US?s website misled customers about their rights. The website told users experiencing error 53 that: ?If the screen or any other part on your iPhone or iPad was replaced somewhere else, contact Apple Support about pricing information for out-of-warranty repairs.?Apple, in response, said the undercover calls made by the ACCC cannot be considered as breaches because consumer law does not exist in ?hypothetical circumstances?. The company said that real customers who had called the store would have received other information from Apple that informed them of their rights under consumer law. Apple denied the message on its US website was an ?express representation? that consumers were not entitled to a free replacement or repair. Apple said the website was referring only to the conditions of the company?s own limited warranty, which existed in addition to a customer?s statutory rights. It was only one part of the communications between the company and its customers over error 53, the company said, and must be interpreted in the broader context. Apple said it had also established an error 53 outreach program and offered replacements or repairs for many of the phones referred to in the ACCC?s case. It also released an update in February last year to resolve the problem and restore the functionality of affected devices. Apple has previously faced court action in the United States relating to error 53, but the case was thrown out last year. ","A sting operation against Apple by Australian consumer watchdog has revealed the staff repeatedly misled iPhone customers over 'error 53' malfunction. The watchdog said the staff wrongly denied consumers free replacements or repair if they had taken their devices to an unauthorised third-party repairer. Between 2014 and 2016, 'error 53' malfunction rendered many iPhones and iPads useless.","Australia's consumer watchdog carried out a sting operation against Apple which it says caught staff repeatedly misleading iPhone customers about their legal rights to a free repair or replacement after an error 53 malfunction.

According to statistics provided by the law and justice ministry, the central government alone is involved in 1,35,060 lawsuits across the country. Experts say India has far too few courts, judges and prosecutors for its 1.3 billion people. Bulk of the cases is pending in subordinate courts thronged by poor litigants who bear the brunt of the creeping system. RAILWAY HAS MOST PENDING CASESThe ministry of railways is the biggest contributor, being a party in 66,685 pending lawsuits of which 10,464 are more than a decade old. Five other ministries with the most number of cases are finance (15,651), communications (12,642), home affairs (11,668), defence (3,433) and health & family welfare (3,275). Listing the Narendra Modi government's achievements in the arena of justice delivery in the last three years, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said a key goal is to reduce government litigation as a result of which the overall case pileup is set to witness a sharp dip. ""A draft national litigation policy is under formulation to make the government a responsible and efficient litigant. I wrote to all governmental departments and ministries to take pro-active measures to settle cases were government is a party,"" said Prasad. Ministry sources said to give an impetus to the goal, a nodal officer has been appointed in each department to keep a track of disputes in which the department is involved, avoid filing appeals except in cases that involve a substantial policy matter, and withdrawal of vexatious litigation.SETTLEMENT ON THE CARDSThe ministry is also making efforts to ensure cases involving two government wings or PSUs are settled out of the court using alternate dispute redress mechanisms. Pendency in the Supreme Court is now at 60,750 cases. About 40 lakh cases are stuck in high courts. The pendency in district and subordinate courts is at 2.74 crore. The department of justice's ""Action Plan To Reduce Government Litigation"" says, ""Government is regarded to be the biggest contributor to litigation in India. Approximately 46 per cent of the total pending cases in courts pertains to the government. This includes cases relating to Public Sector Undertakings and other autonomous bodies. Government litigation includes service matters, disputes with private entities as well as inter-se disputes between two government departments and disputes between two PSUs."" The Legal Information Management and Briefing System (LIMBS) - an endeavour to bring court cases against the government on a single comprehensive online platform - was launched last year. It was an effort to ensure that various ministries do not adopt conflicting stands on the same issue before a court, a growing trend these days, and to make maximum efforts to settle disputes between governments and among public sector units out of the court, which will reduce the backlog to a large extent. Prasad said LIMBS has captured details of more than 1,30,231 cases in which the government is involved. ""It helps to introduce transparency as well as a sense of ownership among various stakeholders/ministries/departments during the entire cycle of a court case,"" he said. The progress of each case - what happened on a particular date, stand adopted by the government, etc - will be available at the click of a button for the official who has registered himself with the LIMBS. Several recent chief justices had been asking the Centre to take immediate steps to ensure that only minimal litigation between government departments and PSUs reach the court. They have also been calling for out-of-court-settlement of disputes to reduce the pileup.","Around 46% cases pending in courts are against the Centre and states, according to data from the Ministry of Law and Justice. The Central government alone has 1.3 lakh pending cases against it. Further, the departments with most pending cases are railways (66,685), finance (15,651), communications (12,642), home affairs (11,668), defence (3,433) and health & family welfare (3,275).","The government is involved in 46% of the 1,35,060 lawsuits across the country, according to statistics provided by the law and justice ministry.

Fewer than one passenger in six now pays to check in luggage on Ryanair. Fares have been driven down as airlines compete to fill their planes; Ryanair is forecasting a further 7% fall in the next 12 months following a 13% drop in average fares from 2016 to 2017. But it can cost more to check in a bag than purchase a seat, with prices typically up to £90 extra for a 20kg suitcase on a return short-haul summer flight. A two-year-old is entitled, like adults, to bring a 10kg suitcase and a second small bag for free. A one-year-old?s cabin allowance can also account for up to 5kg of the family?s total packing, according to a Ryanair spokesman. The airline admitted its takings were falling as passengers looked to squeeze ever more into the cabin, although it made a healthy ?443m (£396m) profit in the last three months.

It?s the people coming with the kitchen sink that could change the policy.?Asked by a reporter if passengers were ?taking the piss?, Sorahan said: ?Some are...

But once we landed in Vrbas, we realised our luggage had not arrived. Thankfully, the girls had kept their fighting gear and gumshields in hand baggage. But then their medical books were in luggage,"" he said.""But the organisers were very cooperative, the supervisor allowed us to compete without medical books as we were stuck in extraordinary circumstances,"" he added.They got no time to rest, relax or get acclimatised but managed to give a good account of themselves once the competition started, incidentally their first international outing after World Championships in May last year.Add to this, it was also their first in the revamped format of three rounds of three minutes each. The previous format of four rounds of two minutes each had been recently scrapped by the International Boxing Association.""Hats off to the girls. They were marvellous in the way they handled the situation. Not one girl complained, they managed things in their own little ways but did not let the situation affect their performance. In fact none of them showed any discomfort in adjusting to the new format,"" Sandhu said. ""We had to manage weight control, we had no spare tracksuits. The federation had told me to go ahead and buy new but by the time we got the time for it, our luggage arrived. It was an eventful trip,"" he added.","India's 10-member contingent won six medals finishing third at the Nations Cup in Serbia, despite missing their luggage and being stranded at the airport for 24 hours. The women boxers' flights got cancelled following snowstorms across Europe. They reached the destination a night before the competition, while their luggage, which contained their medical books, came later.","Indian women's boxers were stranded at the airport for nearly 24 hours and without their luggage for a good part of the Nation's Cup in Serbia.

But this time it is a totally different case,? it added.It is rare for China to call Ladakh a ?disputed? region and make a reference to Kashmir.This is the first time that China has clearly articulated ? through one of its primary official channels - that there is no room for parleys to resolve the weeks-long impasse in Donglang, which is under China?s control but claimed by Bhutan.Until now, the foreign ministry had listed the withdrawal of Indian troops hinted as a precondition for resolving the face-off but had hinted there is an ongoing effort to end it through diplomatic negotiations.Xinhua is an organ of the Chinese government and is affiliated to the State Council, the Communist country?s cabinet.Commentaries published by Xinhua and the People?s Daily, the Communist Party of China (CPC) mouthpiece, are taken to be a reflection of the thoughts of the government and the all-powerful CPC.?India has repeatedly ignored China's call for pulling its border-crossing troops from Doklam area back to its own territory. However, turning a deaf ear to China will but worsen the month-long standoff and put itself further into embarrassment,? the commentary said.It added that India had ?lied? to the world by saying it dispatched troops to Donglang to help its ally Bhutan, whereas ?apparently? Thimphu had extended no invitation to New Delhi to intervene.?New Delhi claimed encroachment of its own territory by China before saying it sent troops to ?protect? its ?ally? Bhutan, a sovereign state which has apparently so far made no such an invitation for the sake of that boundary area,? it said.Bhutan and China don?t have diplomatic ties but have held 24 rounds of talks to resolve a boundary dispute.The commentary, however, described foreign secretary S Jaishankar?s remarks during a recent speech in Singapore as a ?positive? sign.?As an old Chinese saying goes, peace is most precious. It has been noticed that Indian Foreign Secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar recently has made positive remarks in Singapore, saying that ?India and China should not let differences become disputes?,? it said.?What China would like to see more are corresponding actions taken by India.?China has a will to solve the problem peacefully by diplomatic means, and China also cherishes the peace and serenity in the border areas, but the precondition is that the trespassers of India must withdraw unconditionally.? ","China on Saturday said there is ""no room"" for negotiations to resolve the military face-off and the only solution is the withdrawal of Indian troops from the Doka La region. Adding that the situation could get ""worse"", China's state-run Xinhua News Agency said that India will face ""embarrassment"" if it does not withdraw its border troops to its own side.","China on Saturday said there is ""no room"" for negotiations to resolve the military face-off in the Sikkim sector and the only solution is the withdrawal of Indian troops from the Donglang or Doklam region.

It is not believed to involve fraud.However, a statement attributed by the Times to Mackenzie?s son, Peter Mackenzie, said his father had a serious health issue and had resigned.

Family members said Maan Devi left the home around 4am on Wednesday but lost her way, reaching a predominantly upper caste neighbourhood where people spotted her. ?She pleaded that she had lost her way but they took as one responsible for chopping women hair in Mutnai village and killed her,? said the victim?s daughter-in-law Kalpana Jatav.Local police first denied the death was connected to the ?ghost barber? panic. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Fatehabad, Dr Tej Veer Singh said a case was registered including charges relating to atrocities against Dalits, and teams were keeping a vigil in the area where the woman was killed.  The police also appeared to deny that the woman was beaten to death. ?The post-mortem report of Maan Devi indicates she died of cardiac arrest and not due to beating,? Singh said. Devi?s son has named two suspects, both from the upper caste Baghel community, in his complaint where he also said that his mother?s body had been thrown back in their village. Till Thursday, neither was arrested.Agra and villages in districts nearby were the latest to report the hair-cutting mystery that seems to be spreading since first being recorded in parts of the National Capital Region last week. Officials said on Friday that more ?sightings? were reported from the region, and the state?s Inspector General issued an appeal for people to remain calm.Women in at least five states have reported waking up to the sound of scissors, spotting black cats, and seeing ghosts and shadows. Some claimed they found portions of their hair chopped off, and others reported falling unconscious with fear.Police have dismissed the allegations as rumours in several of these cases, and administration officials are now issuing alerts for local law enforcement to tackle fear mongering. FROM MONKEY MAN TO UFOsParts of India, particularly rural districts where superstitious beliefs are common, have often been at the centre of mass hysteria events. In the summer of 2001, people in Delhi said they had spotted a mysterious monkey-like creature that appeared in the night and attacked people. Large colonies of the capital were gripped by fear as more and more bizarre ?sightings? were recorded. Vigilante groups patrolled the streets with sticks for weeks, before officials and psychiatric experts said the panic was created by ?figments of people?s imagination? that was made worse by the media coverage at the time.A year later, people in Eastern Uttar Pradesh reported spotting a light-emitting flying object that would attack them at night and scratch their face. Many referred to it as the ?muhnochwa?, a Bhojpuri amalgam that loosely translates to ?face snatcher?. At the height of the panic, people went off streets after sundown. Scientists from IIT Kanpur were roped in to investigate the event, and the ruled out the existence of the creature. The closest explanation, they said, could have been sightings of ball lightening, a rare meteorological phenomenon. Years earlier, in 1995, a more innocuous mass delusion took place when people across the country reported seeing idols of the Hindu god Ganesha drinking milk. ","A 60-year old Dalit woman was allegedly lynched in Agra after villagers thought that she was behind the recent cases of chopping hair of sleeping women.

Of the 8,591 highway liquor shops affected by the Supreme Court order, 2,000 are yet to be relocated while 3,000 shop owners have surrendered their liquor licences, said UP Excise Minister Jai Pratap Singh. ""We have incurred a loss of about Rs 5,000 crore in 2016-17 fiscal ending March 31. Out of the target of realising Rs 19,000 crore, the excise department could generate Rs 14,000 crore following the apex court order order,"" the minister told PTI. The Supreme Court had last year ordered a ban on all liquor shops along national as well as state highways across the country and prohibited all signages indicating presence of liquor vends. The Supreme Court again on March 31 reiterated its December 15, 2016 order to shut down, by April 1, establishments selling and serving liquor within 500 metres of national and state highways, but relaxed the distance to 220 m for cities, towns and municipal areas with a population of 20,000 or less. According to latest data compiled by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), accidents due to drunk driving have the highest fatality rate among all accidents. NCRB data showed that some 42 per cent of drunk driving victims ended up dead in 2015 ? this was a far higher rate than that of accidents caused by over speeding and reckless driving. Highlighting his departments initiatives for going cashless, Singh said, ""We are introducing a cashless system in liquor shops and asking them to install point-of-sale (POS) machines. Though it will difficult in rural areas, we are asking shops to switch over to cashless payments."" On media reports suggesting that the cashless system is being introduced to deter teenagers from purchasing liquor, the minister said there is already a law which does not allow sale of liquor to minors. About sale of liquor near religious places and schools, he said, ""An SC order in 2008 says no to liquor vending with a radius of 75 metre of a school or religious place. But, with increase in population density, the number of schools and hospitals have increased leading to conflicts."" ""We have decided that no liquor shop will be relocated within 500 metre of religious places or hospitals. In case of objection, even residential colonies will come under the ambit. At the moment it is not in a very formal shape. But we are working on it,"" the minister said. About excise revenue expectations for 2017-18, the minister said his department has fixed a target of Rs 20,000 crore. The minister said that Yogi Adityanath government will introduce its new excise policy from April 2018 and the government plans to break the syndicate system in liquor trade. ""We are working on the new excise policy before finalising it,"" he said. The new excise policy may introduce a system of bar code on each bottle in a bid to check black marketing and pilferage in liquor sale, mostly in country-made alcohol products. ","The Uttar Pradesh government has incurred a loss of about ?5,000 crore in 2016-17 following the Supreme Court order banning all liquor shops along national and state highways.

Each of the women said the chopping of their braids happened soon after they experienced sudden unbearable headaches and fell unconscious. The braids were left behind at the spot.Though the police could neither comment confidently on the motive behind the mischief, nor trace the people behind it, they claimed that CCTV cameras had captured three men suspiciously roaming around in the village.Speaking to the media, Surender Kumar, DCP (south-west), vehemently opposed villagers? suspicion that these activities had supernatural connections. ?Witchcraft is totally ruled out. We are probing this in a scientific manner,? he said adding that theft could also be a possible motive. Villagers, however, denied any thefts in the area.According to media reports, around a dozen similar activities were reported in places such as Gurgaon, Palwal and Mewat in Haryana. However, Sunday was the first time this was reported in Delhi.The first victim was a 55-year-old woman living in Kanganheri village in outer Delhi?s Chhawla. A woman with red hair, she was returning home from her farm around 10.30 am on Sunday when she suddenly experienced a severe headache.The moment she entered her home, she locked the outermost six-feet high iron gate and jumped into a bed in the drawing room, leaving the drawing room door ajar. Her sleeping position was such that her face and gaze were away from the door.?Suddenly, I felt extreme pain in my head. I held my head and screamed for my grandchildren. But my screams were drowned in the sound of the cooler,? she told HT.When her granddaughter visited the drawing room a few minutes later, she found the woman unconscious on the floor. ?Her chopped braid was lying on the ground. We immediately informed the villagers and the police,? her son told HT. He had run out of the house to see if there was anyone, but he could not find any stranger.?No one approached me on my way back home from the farm. No one followed me into my house and no one touched me when I lay on the bed. I don?t remember anyone chopping off my hair either,? she said. Unaware of similar happenings in Haryana, the local police initially suspected the role of one of her relatives. But even as the villagers were discussing this unusual activity, a similar case happened in another house in the village with a population of over 5,000.This time it was a 45-year-old woman who had been dropped off at her home by her son around 8 pm. She had just got off the bike when she reported headache. Her son took her to bed and left. Within minutes, she experienced a similar pain and fell unconscious. When she woke up, she found her reddish braid chopped off. She too had not seen the culprit. By 11.30 pm, a 50-year-old woman living at the other end of the village lost her whitish braid. She had to be taken to a hospital before she regained consciousness. The same pattern in all three cases has prompted police to suspect that the culprits intoxicated the women.?There were also thefts at one or two of these women?s homes,? the DCP said. The villagers, however, rejected the police?s claims of intoxication or thefts. A case of poisoning, outraging the modesty of a woman, theft and under arms act has been registered at Chhawla police station.","After reports of approximately a dozen such cases in Haryana, two women in Delhi have complained about their braids being chopped off by unknown persons. Both the cases, wherein women did not see who chopped off their braids, occurred in Kanganheri village. Following this, villagers decided to inform the police and take turns to keep round-the-clock guard.

Salehi, an MIT graduate scientist who has also served as foreign minister, was the second most senior Iranian negotiator, dealing with technical aspects, during nearly two years of talks between Tehran and six of the world?s major powers that led to the final nuclear accord in Vienna in July 2015.Although Trump has promised to ?dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran?, he has not so far taken any concrete steps to scrap it. Last month, two days before Iran?s presidential election, his administration announced that it was continuing to waive nuclear-related sanctions under the agreement despite Washington toughening up its overall Iran policy. Salehi said it was possible to rescue the deal?s engagement if it was met with reciprocal gestures. ?Often following hard-won engagement, some western nations, whether distracted by short-sighted political motivations or the lucrative inducements of regional actors, walk away and allow the whole situation to return to the status quo ante,? wrote Salehi, who is also a vice-president of Iran.Salehi warned of ?chaotic behaviour? and ?further tension and conflict? if the other side disregarded Iran?s security concerns, failed to adhere to its commitments and insisted on what he called alternative facts including ideas such as the ?clash of civilisations?, ?Sunni-Shia conflict?, ?Persian-Arab enmity? and the ?Arab-Israeli axis against Iran?. His article comes at a time of simmering tensions in the Middle East, where relations between Tehran and Riyadh, which are on opposite sides of many regional conflicts such as the wars in Syria and Yemen, have deteriorated. Trump?s first post-election foreign trip to Riyadh tilted the regional balance, and contributed in part to the diplomatic isolation of Qatar by Saudi Arabia and its allies, who have accused the tiny emirate of funding terrorists and appeasing Iran.

Ramachandran has told Reuters.Ramachandran said the IOA also wanted India to host the Asian Beach Games in 2020, the Olympic Council of Asia's general assembly that year, and the International Olympic Committee session in 2021.The aim, Ramachandran said, was to use the engagement as a catalyst for the growth of Olympic sports in India and to help improve the country's miserable standing in pretty much every sport apart from cricket.As the world's second-most populous nation after China, Ramachandran said it was time for India to follow its powerful neighbour in showcasing its burgeoning economic muscle through sport.Dismissing concerns about whether India can afford to stage such huge sporting spectacles, Ramachandran said the country was one of the few in the region that did have the means.It was up to the government to set the wheels in motion, he told Reuters in an interview.""From my part, I am telling them if you bid, I will make sure you get it,"" he added.Ramachandran said he had spoken about India's prospects of hosting an Olympics with IOC President Thomas Bach, an indication of the early groundwork required for a serious bid.""You cannot take a decision today and say, 'I want to host an Olympic Games tomorrow.' It is an eight-year process. So you have to start now,"" Ramachandran said.""If you are looking at anything it's 2032.

The IOC will award both the 2024 and 2028 Summer Games at the same time and the expectation is that the two cities will host one each.For the 2022 Winter Games, four of six bidders pulled out citing high costs or lack of support, leaving Beijing to beat Almaty in the final vote.Ramachandran was confident India, which has Asia's third-largest economy, would be capable of meeting the costs.""India is one of the emerging economies,"" he said. ""Even assuming you spend $12 billion on an Olympic event, $6 billion will be given to you by the IOC.""What is $6 billion over a period of eight years for a country which has the size of the economy which India has today?""Not many countries today wish to host the Olympics. China has already had everything possible that can be hosted.""In terms of hosting experience, India has successfully staged several global cricket tournaments, and FIFA say they are satisfied with preparations for the Under-17 World Cup in October.But a question mark over the country's ability to host an international multi-sports event has hung over India since the 2010 Commonwealth Games, a $6 billion event billed as Delhi's answer to the Beijing Olympics.LEARNED FROM MISTAKESA series of embarrassments over leaking stadiums and filthy accommodation culminated in Games chief Suresh Kalmadi spending nine months in prison for inflating tenders worth millions of dollars.Ramachandran said there would be no repeat of those blunders.""We have learnt from our mistakes. You see the South Asian Games (in 2016) that was hosted in Guwahati. Nobody said anything,"" he added.""We should stick to what we know best - technical conduct of the Games. Even when we hosted the Commonwealth Games in India, (the IOC) praised the technical conduct of the event. And we also did very well in the medals tally.""While the hosts finished second to Australia at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, to say that India has underperformed at the Olympics is an understatement.India has won just 28 medals since 1900, with Abhinav Bindra claiming the country's only individual gold medal in the men's 10 metre air rifle in Beijing.",The Indian Olympic Association's (IOA) chief N Ramachandran has revealed that IOA has asked the government for permission to bid for the 2032 Olympics and 2030 Asian Games.

Although it has also cut travel and diplomatic ties with Qatar, Egypt did not expel Qatari citizens or ask Egyptians to leave Qatar.Al-Thani declined to explain why Egypt was not included.?Obviously all options are available. But we have not raised a consultation request with Egypt yet,? he said.In its WTO case, Qatar would also draw attention to the impact the boycott was having on other WTO members, he added.Many trade diplomats say that using national security as a defence risks weakening the WTO by removing a taboo that could enable countries to escape international trade obligations.Al-Thani said governments had wide discretion to invoke the national security defence but it had to be subject to oversight.?If it is self-regulating, that is a danger to the entire multilateral trading system itself. And we believe the WTO will take that into consideration.?Qatar also raised the boycott at a meeting of the United Nations?

ART is the combination of several antiretroviral medicines used to slow the rate at which HIV makes copies of itself (multiplies) in the body. Prasanna said the state has 26,000 HIV positive people and of them, 10,289 were being provided medicines through five ART and 12 link ART centres (which work like sub-centres of ART), according to the set guidelines.

However, it did not affect him. In December 2008, the UN Security Council, under its Resolution 1267, imposed sanctions on JuD and Hafiz Saeed for supporting Al Qaeda and Taliban. India had named Hafiz Saeed, LeT and JuD as the perpetrators of the series of terrorist attacks in Mumbai in November 2008. Since then there has been an unending drama of Hafiz Saeed being put under house arrest or detained cursorily before being set free even if the US declared a bounty of USD 10 million on his head in 2012. Things took a turn after Donald Trump was elected president in the United States. The US clearly told Pakistan to act against JuD after its name prominently figured in the report of the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering. If Pakistan failed to comply to this it would be put on the list of blacklisted countries in the International Cooperative Review Group (ICRG). That would make it necessary for Pakistan to put a formal request each time it went about transacting any business through any of the international financial institutions. Left with no other option, Pakistan had to put Hafiz Saeed under house arrest on January 30. Even if symbolic, it made a huge difference that we can see now with TAJK ban, as Donald Trump is completing six months in office. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump in a joint statement, during Indian PM's US tour, labeled Pakistan a terror haven. Not to mention the US has designated Pakistan-based Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin as a global terrorist. Pakistan, probably, was expecting all this to happen, and therefore would have decided to act on Hafiz Saeed's new terror front before it became another international rallying point against it.","Pakistan has put a ban on Tehreek-e-Azadi-Jammu & Kashmir (TAJK), the new terror outfit of the 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind and Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed.

It doesn't know if the company has been declared a defaulter,"" said Dhingra.While Mail Today was the first to report that such a loan, nearly Rs 55 crore, had been given to Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines by the Oriental Bank of Commerce-led consortium, the latter had been stonewalling giving information regarding who approved the loan and on what grounds, such as collaterals etc, by invoking Section 8 (1) (h) of the RTI Act. The bank had argued that the matter was pending before different investigating agencies and disclosure of the information could hamper the investigation process. The concerned enforcement agencies are the CBI, ED and the SFIO.SUPREME COURT PRECEDENTThe CIC had earlier, at the case hearing on February 10, questioned the invoking of the exemption clause. In its latest judgment in the case, the CIC quoted several judgments from the Supreme Court as well as the Delhi High Court and observed that the bank had to furnish information asked by Dhingra and that the exemption did not apply.IC Sharat Sabharwal observed: ""Except for stating that the matter is under investigation of some agencies, the respondents (bank) have not made any other submission to justify invocation of Section 8 (1) (h) to deny most of the information and why its disclosure would hamper the investigation process. As stated above, the investigation agencies have chosen not to make any submission in spite of an opportunity given to them for the purpose.""The IC also cited that the exemption clause itself made it clear that ""a public authority may allow access to information, if public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests.""The IC also quoted, among others, an SC observation in the case of UP Financial Corporation vs gem Cap India Pvt (AIR 1993, 1435).

But the team found that the chances of such events were so remote as to be extremely unlikely ? there was little chance of a supernova occurring close enough to an Earth-like planet to kill off the creatures, and it would take an impact from an asteroid or dwarf planet near the mass of Vesta for the oceans to boil. ?There are about 17 [asteroids] this big in our solar system, but they are all on sufficient orbits that they will never intersect with us,? said Sloan. The upshot, he said, was that it was very unlikely any cosmic event would be so catastrophic as to sterilise an Earth-like planet where life, of the sort we know, had got going. ?Because [tardigrades] are so hardy it means that events that we are worried about as human beings, and rightly so, certainly wouldn?t concern you if you just considered all life,? said Sloan. Matthew Cobb, professor of zoology at the University of Manchester, who was not involved in the study said the findings were reassuring for the future of life on Earth.?It suggests that the complete eradication of life on Earth is extremely unlikely until we get to the point that the sun enlarges and all the oceans boil away,? he said. ?Many organisms, in particular animals and bacteria, live in the deep ocean, which the authors show would be unaffected by any conceivable cosmic cataclysm.?Mark Blaxter, professor of evolutionary genomics at the University of Edinburgh, agreed, adding that there are other organisms have a similar survival strategy to tardigrades. What?s more, he said, there are also organisms that live very deep underground in hot water within continental and under-sea-floor rocks. ?Sterilising the planet would have to deal with these too,? he noted. He also stressed that even tardigrades are not invincible. ?[Land-based] tardigrades stay alive in extreme conditions by drying out completely. So if there was no water left ? there would be no ?live? tardigrades, just dried up ones,? said Blaxter. ?And if there was some water left so that the tardigrades could re-animate, if there was no food left they eat algae and fungi - they too would be dead in a couple of weeks.?Cobb, too, noted that even if the tardigrades were the only survivors, they would face a struggle. ?For the tardigrades to inherit the Earth, whatever catastrophe swept over the planet would have to return to normal-ish conditions within a matter of decades at most, or it really could be curtains,? he said.","The most resilient form of life on Earth, tardigrade, also known as water bear, will survive until the Sun dies, as per an Oxford University research. The eight-legged micro-animal can survive for 30 years without food or water, and endure temperature extremes from -270ºC to 150ºC. Further, tardigrades can withstand catastrophic events like large asteroid impacts, supernovae, and gamma-ray bursts.","Scientists from the University of Oxford have found that tardigrades, a micro-organism with the appearance of a crumpled hoover bag, would survive any cosmic disaster that might strike Earth. The creatures can survive extreme conditions, including exposure to radiation that would kill them, and they just walk away from it like nothing happened, scientists said."

However, the number of defaulters seem to be on the rise.

While other international Vogue editors such as Wintour in the US and Carine Roitfeld in France are considered icy style icons, Shulman laughingly told the Guardian of being presented in one feature as the ?chain-smoking 50-year-old Toyota-driving divorcee?.When she was appointed it was suggested that she ?could become better acquainted with a hairbrush?, according to the New York Times. But Shulman used her reputation to define her magazine. ?She was never starry in a very conscious way. It was quite British, just like her magazine,? said one senior colleague.While US Vogue is known for its glossy and expensive US sportswear shoots, the British edition is considered more creative and original, even bohemian. Although the rivalry with Wintour is real, according to magazine insiders, it is entirely professional. In the BBC documentary Shulman is shown scooping a planned Wintour exclusive by putting Rihanna on the cover. ?It?s all journalistic pride. They get on fine,? said one senior colleague.Plum Sykes, contributing editor of US Vogue who started her career as a junior assistant under Shulman in the 1990s, said: ?She is very British, very laid-back. I am sure her Manolos are muddy. But she has done a good job, especially for British fashion.?Shulman has said: ?It does amaze me when people say ?Well, you don?t look like the editor of Vogue?. Because I am the editor of Vogue. So what else does the editor of Vogue look like??In an interview with the Observer she also talked openly about using Xanax to deal with panic attacks. Given that her life might appear ?sort of lovely and easy? to outsiders, she said: ?I think it?s quite good to show you?ve had bad things happen as well.?Turning 60 later this year, those close to Shulman said she was still to decide what she would do next. A former newspaper columnist who wrote her first novel, Can We Still Be Friends, a few years ago, she is expected to write more. Names in the frame to replace her include current deputy Emily Sheffield, the sister of Samantha Cameron.The oldest of three children brought up in Belgravia, she attended St Paul?s school in London. After a degree in social anthropology from the University of Sussex she worked briefly for two recording labels before becoming a secretary at Over 21 magazine. Her first journalistic job was at Tatler, also part of Condé Nast and which had also employed her brother as art director.Within eight years she was editing men?s magazine GQ, where she increased sales by 30%, and two years after that she was made editor of Vogue.Her mother, Drusilla Beyfus, was Vogue associate editor in the 70s while her father, Milton Shulman, had been Vogue film critic, prompting Coleridge to say that Vogue was ?almost in her blood? when she was appointed.Despite this, she has always told interviewers that having two parents who were journalists meant she had ?wanted to be a hairdresser?, or a musician.In 2015 she wrote about how glad she was to return to work when her only son, now 21 and a history of art student, was 15 weeks old.Although she has refused to publish articles lauding diets or cosmetic surgery, Vogue has been no stranger to controversy. In the early 1990s a Kate Moss shoot was criticised for encouraging ?heroin chic? and in 1997, the watchmaker Omega pulled an ad campaign because of the issue.Early on, Shulman appeared to dismiss these complaints by saying ?Not many people have actually said to me that they have looked at my magazine and decided to become anorexic.?But in 2009, she wrote a letter to major international fashion houses complaining that their ?minuscule? sample sizes were forcing fashion editors to use models with ?jutting bones?. Her January 2017 issue featured a plus-size model, Ashley Graham, on the cover.On the weight issue, she said: ?What is an issue is to try to make young women feel more comfortable with how they look in general and not feel they have to look a cookie-cutter way to be a success in life. That?s really what I?m interested in.?","The editor of British Vogue Alexandra Shulman will be stepping down from her post after over twenty-five years, as announced by the magazine's publisher Condé Nast. Condé Nast managing director Nicholas Coleridge, said: ""Alex has been the longest-serving and most successful editor of Vogue in its 100 years history.""

The Chinese government is very clear that it wants peaceful resolution at current state of the situation for which withdrawal of Indian troops from the area is a ""pre- condition"", he asserted. ""The first priority is that the Indian troops unconditionally pull back to the Indian side of the boundary. That is the precondition for any meaningful dialogue between China and India,"" he said. China and India have been engaged in a standoff in the Dokalam area near the Bhutan trijunction for past 19 days after a Chinese armys construction party came to build a road. Doka La is the Indian name for the region which Bhutan recognises as Dokalam, while China claims it as part of its Donglang region. China and Bhutan are engaged in talks over the resolution of the area. Bhutan, however, has no diplomatic ties with China and it is supported militarily and diplomatically by India. ""The situation is grave and made me deeply worried. It is the first time that Indian troops have crossed the mutually recognised boundary and trespassed into Chinas territory, triggering a close range face off between Chinese and Indian border troops. Now 19 days have passed, but the situation still has not eased,"" Luo said. He also asserted that India has no right to interfere with the China-Bhutan boundary talks, nor is it entitled to make territorial claims on behalf of Bhutan. On the standoff, the Ministry of External Affairs had said India was ""deeply concerned at the recent Chinese actions and has conveyed to the Chinese government that such construction would represent a significant change of status quo with serious security implications for India"". ","Chinese ambassador to India Luo Zhaohui on Tuesday said that India-China military standoff in the Sikkim section is ""grave"". There is ""no scope for a compromise"" in the region, Zhaohui asserted. He added that withdrawal of Indian troops from the area is a ""pre-condition for any meaningful dialogue between China and India"" to achieve a peaceful resolution to the conflict.","China has ruled out a compromise in the military standoff with India in the Sikkim section and put the onus on New Delhi to resolve the ""grave"" situation. China's Ambassador to India Luo Zhaohui said, ""There has been talk about this option, that option. It is up to your government policy (whether to exercise military option)."""

The Washington Post/ABC News poll, which put Trump?s six-month approval rating at a historic 70-year low, came amid mounting controversy over Russian interference in the 2016 election. It emerged on Saturday that Trump?s campaign committee made a payment to the legal firm representing the president?s eldest son almost two weeks before a meeting between Trump Jr and a Russian lawyer promising compromising information on Hillary Clinton was made public.Trump now has a 36% approval rating, down six points from his first 100 days? rating. The poll found that 48% believed America?s leadership in the world is weaker than before the billionaire took office, while support for Republican plans to replace Barack Obama?s Affordable Care Act was at just 24% compared with 50% who support the former president?s signature healthcare policy. Trump, who has spent the weekend at his private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, attempted to downplay the poll?s findings. On Sunday morning he used Twitter to claim, incorrectly, that ?almost 40% [approval] is not bad at this time? and that the poll in question had been ?just about the most inaccurate around election time!?.In fact, the Washington Post/ABC poll came close to predicting the popular vote on election day ? which Hillary Clinton won by 2.5m ballots, Trump taking the White House in the electoral college ? and no president has suffered such low ratings at this early stage in their tenure since such polling began in 1945.The poll also found that 63% of people thought the June 2016 meeting between senior members of Trump?s inner circle, including Donald Trump Jr and son-in-law Jared Kushner, and a group of Russians including the lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, was inappropriate.On Saturday, a campaign finance report filed to the Federal Election Commission revealed that Trump?s campaign committee had paid $50,000 to Trump Jr?s lawyer Alan Futerfas on 27 June, 13 days before the New York Times revealed the meeting had taken place. Trump himself told reporters on Wednesday he had only been made aware of the 2016 meeting, which occurred in Trump Tower, ?two or three days ago? ? raising the prospect that his campaign committee could have known about the contact before the president did. On Sunday, Trump?s personal attorney Jay Sekulow appeared on all five TV political talk shows to offer a spurious defense of the meeting. Sekulow appeared to blame secret service officers for allowing the Russians into Trump Tower. ?I wonder why the secret service ? if this was nefarious ? why the secret service allowed these people in?? he told ABC News. ?The president had secret service protection at that point, and that raised a question with me.?A spokesman for the secret service later confirmed that Trump Jr was not under the agency?s protection at the time of the meeting and ?thus we would not have screened anyone he was meeting with?.Under pressure from the New York Times, Trump Jr this week released damning emails revealing he eagerly embraced what he was told was a Russian government attempt to damage the Clinton campaign.The emails show music promoter Rob Goldstone telling the future president?s son that ?the crown prosecutor of Russia? had offered ?to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father?.The New York Times reported that Trump signed off on his son?s first statement to the Times about the meeting, which like subsequent statements was soon revealed not to be a full account of events.Kushner, Trump?s senior adviser, and then campaign manager Paul Manafort also attended the meeting. It was revealed on Friday that Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian American lobbyist and former Soviet military officer, was present as well.Earlier on Sunday morning, Trump tweeted more outspoken support for his eldest son.?Hillary Clinton can illegally get the questions to the debate & delete 33,000 emails but my son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media?? the president wrote.Trump has previously described the political storm over his son?s meeting as ?the greatest witch-hunt in political history? and ?sad!? and said anyone would have taken the meeting as offered.Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Thursday, the president said 39-year-old Trump Jr was ?a good boy? and added: ?And he had a meeting, nothing happened with the meeting. It was a short meeting, as he told me ? because I only heard about it two or three days ago.?The Trump campaign committee?s finance filing also shows it paid $89,000 to the Trump Corporation, which is led by Trump Jr and his brother, Eric, for ?legal consulting?.It was announced on Saturday that Trump had hired Washington attorney Ty Cobb to serve as his special counsel regarding the Russia investigations being run by the Senate judiciary and intelligence committees and special counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director appointed after Trump fired his successor James Comey in May.The move seemingly reflects the president?s growing acceptance that the investigations will linger over his tenure for months or even years.On Sunday morning, he also tweeted: ?Thank you to all of the supporters, who far out-numbered the protesters, yesterday at the Women?s US Open. Very cool!?The golfing event Trump referred to took place at his club where, according to reports, members pay up to $100,000 in joining fees. ","Donald Trump's six-month approval rating stands at 36%, the lowest among all US Presidents in the last 70 years, according to a national poll published on Sunday. The poll found that 48% of US citizens believe that the country's leadership in the world is weaker than before the billionaire took office. However, Trump called the poll result ""not bad"".","The Washington Post/ABC News poll on Donald Trump's approval rating has plunged six points from his first 100 days in office.

Along with his parents and wife, Bharti, a reporter and social worker, was driving down to visit a sick relative in his native village in Bihar. The drive, however, turned out to be one filled with horror and one that made Bharti fear for his and his family's life after a large group of people he identified as Bajrang Dal activists accosted them and made Bharti chant 'Jai Shri Ram'. That would not have happened if his wife wasn't wearing a nikab and if his father had shaved that day, Bharti indicated in a Facebook post recounting the incident. On June 28, Bharti and his family were on their way to Rahimbad, a village in Bihar's Samastipur district located around 75 kilometers north east of capital Patna. As the family neared their destination, they got caught in a traffic jam at Margan Chowk on National Highway 28. Bharti says he and family joined the line of trucks that had been halted by people who seemed to Bajrang Dal activists. They were sporting saffron scarves around their necks and were chanting 'Jai Shri Ram' slogans, Bharti recounts. ""As they neared my car, I asked them what the commotion was about,"" Bharti says. In response, Bharti says, a few of the alleged Bajrang Dal men looked inside his car and noticed his father, who had a beard, and his wife, who was wearing a nikab. ""On seeing this, their sloganeering intensified, and before I could understand what was going on, two people shoved their heads into the car through the windows and said, 'Chant Jai Shri Ram or we will set your car on fire', sending me in shock,"" Bharti recounts in his Facebook post. Fearing for his and his family's life, Bharti goes on to describe how he immediately did what he was asked to, and chanted 'Jai Shri Ram' so that he and his family could escape from the spot alive. 'RESPECT RAM'""I respect all religions and respect Ram from the bottom of my heart,"" Bharti says in his Facebook post. ""I do not have a problem with chanting Jai Shri Ram, but the fear-filled manner in which I was made to do that [on that day] was not nice,"" Bharti says. Having followed the men's commands, Bharti and his family quickly escape from the location, taking another route to Rahimbad. After driving for a few minutes, Bharti stopped and tweeted to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar recounting his ordeal in a short sentence.

The apex court has dealt with several such cases before but surprisingly it has not given a consistent interpretation of the laws and provisions of Constitution. The conflict arises when personal laws are perceived to be in violation of the fundamental rights.Article 13 of the Constitution states that any law, which goes against the provisions of fundamental rights, shall be void to the extent of contravention.SUPREME COURT'S STAND ON PERSONAL LAWSPersonal laws in India are codified and uncodified - existing in custom and practice. Over the years, the Supreme Court has taken differing views on the question of precedence of personal laws over the fundamental rights. In Krishna Singh vs Mathura Ahir case of 1980, Maharshi Avdesh case of 1994 and Ahmedabad Women Action Group case of 1997, the Supreme Court held that personal laws could not be challenged for being in contravention of the provisions of fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution.Many believe that this interpretation of the Supreme Court has been based on a ruling of the Bombay High Court in Narsu Appa Mali case of 1951. In this case, the Bombay High Court has enunciated that personal laws are not 'laws' under Article 13 of the Constitution.But, a three-Judge Supreme Court bench in Mudaliar case of 1996 held that personal laws are void to the extent that they are in violation of the fundamental rights.All these aspects and arguments are likely to be placed and reexamined the Supreme Court during the seven-day hearing of the triple talaq matter this summer.SOME RECENT CASES OF PERSONAL LAWS: SHAH BANO MATTERThe most famous case relating to personal laws was that of Shah Bano, who had fought long drawn legal battle seeking maintenance from her ex-husband. In 1985, the Supreme Court had directed Shah Bano's husband to pay her alimony according to the laws applicable to other Indians.The Supreme Court had rejected the argument of Shah Bano's ex-husband that since she was paid during the period of iddat - the waiting period after divorce and also the amount of mehr, she was not entitled to any further maintenance under the Muslim personal law.MARY ROY CASEThe very next year, the Supreme Court decided another case relating to Christian personal law in the 1986-case of Mary Roy. The Supreme Court ruled that Syrian Christian women were entitled to equal share in their father's property.Before the Supreme Court order, the Syrian Christian community settled property inheritance issue as per the Travancore Succession Act, 1916 and Cochin Succession Act, 1921 while other Christians followed the Indian Succession Act of 1925 for the same. As per the Travancore and Cochin Acts, women received only a quarter of their male siblings or Rs 5,000 whichever was less.DANIAL LATIFI CASEDanial Latifi was the lawyer of Shah Bano, who has won a maintenance case against her ex-husband in the Supreme Court. But, the apex court verdict was not received well by the conservative segment of Muslim society.In order to pacify the swelling sentiment of the community, the then Rajiv Gandhi government enacted the Muslim Women (Protection on Divorce Act), 1986. The new Act overturned the judgment of the Supreme Court providing that a man was required to pay maintenance to his divorced wife only during the period of Iddat.Danial Latifi challenged the constitutional validity of the Personal law. The Supreme Court, in 2001 during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, held that the Muslim Women (Protection on Divorce Act), 1986 did not violate the Constitution or the fundamental rights.The Supreme Court maintained that the personal laws need not be tested on the touchstone of the provisions of the fundamental rights.TRIPLE TALAQ CASE IN BOMBAY HIGH COURTIn another case of triple talaq, the Bombay High Court held in 2002 that if wife contests this practice of divorce, it needed to be proved in a court of law. In its 88-page judgment, the Bombay High Court ruled that ""divorces between Muslims couples will now have to be convincingly proved under Civil Procedure Act and Indian Evidence Act. A mere statement, written or oral, by a Muslim man seeking divorce will not be enough proof of his having obtained the divorce.""The Bombay High Court also held that a Muslim man did not have a unilateral right to divorce his wife by triple talaq. The man is bound to provide good reasons for a divorce.ADOPTION BY MUSLIM WOMENThe Supreme Court again delivered a landmark judgment in 2014 on the question of adoption of child by a Muslim woman. The Muslim personal law does not give women of the community the right to adopt children.A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by the then Chief Justice of India P Sathasivam ruled that Muslim women had the right to legally adopt children like any other Indian citizen. The Supreme Court held that the right to adopt children could not be denied by Muslim personal law.RIGHT OF UNWED MOTHERUnder the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act of 1956 father was held as the natural guardian of a Hindu child. If a child was born out of wedlock, only then the mother could be considered a natural guardian.But, in 2015, the Supreme Court held that an unwed mother can legally become the sole guardian of a child. The apex court held the consent of the biological father is not necessary for the mother to become legal guardian of the child.The Supreme Court observed that the father could not have 'a preferential right over the mother in the matter of guardianship'.ALSO READ |Triple talaq: Supreme Court begins hearing on whether it is fundamental to Islam","The Supreme Court has taken differing views on the question of precedence of personal laws over fundamental rights. In 1985, the court directed Muslim woman Shah Bano's husband to pay her alimony according to the laws applicable to other Indians. In several separate cases, the court said personal laws could not be challenged for being in violation of fundamental rights.","The Supreme Court has taken differing views on the question of precedence of personal laws over fundamental rights in several cases.

(His official 4 Rajaji Marg residence is under renovation.) His twin Dachshunds, Dash and Tickle, shoot around like little guided torpedoes clad in identical red-and- black-trimmed winter fleece. Staff officers and Tavor rifle-wielding bodyguards of the special forces flank the fleet of black armoured Scorpios waiting to make the short two km drive to his office deep within the sandstone corridors of South Block. The general appears in the verandah of his home, proffers a firm handshake. He's of medium height, stockily built, with salt and pepper hair and a neatly trimmed white moustache. He listens carefully, looks you in the eye when he speaks, and the clearly articulated sentences are delivered like a military drum roll. He clearly plays on the front foot. There is simply no question that will induce any hesitation on his part, from tackling China and Pakistan, surgical strikes, the controversial Cold Start war doctrine to the polemic around his selection as army chief, superseding two senior army commanders. As he sat down for an extensive interview with Executive Editor Sandeep Unnithan, General Rawat revealed why he was supremely confident of navigating the minefield that lies ahead in his three-year tenure. Excerpts:What do you see as your main security challenges and how do you plan to handle developments like the reorganisation of China's armed forces?The primary role of the armed forces is the defence of the borders, preparation for conventional warfare, maintaining internal security and focusing on disaster relief. We are studying the restructuring of the PLA to see its efficacy. We will study their reforms and see whether they have relevance in our context. If so, we will put them across with modifications to the government.The army's China-specific Mountain Strike Corps has been languishing for want of funds. Is this relevant in our context?We raised the Mountain Strike Corps (MSC) as part of a transition from dissuasion and deterrence to credible deterrence. All adversaries respect credible strength, which comes from such formations capable of striking across the border. We are expected to remain defensive in order to ensure there are no incursions and the sanctity of the borders is maintained. But you cannot always remain defensive. We must also have the capability to conduct offensive operations. Whether these forces are going to be used physically will depend on the situation, but surely these forces meet the purpose of credible deterrence. So, we'll certainly give impetus to raising the corps. The government has given us permission to induct manpower, infrastructure development along the border is taking place, weapons and equipment are coming in.Did the army's September 29, 2016 surgical strikes define our new red lines in a strong response to a high-casualty attack by terrorists?All nations and armies define their own thresholds. The December 13, 2001 Parliament attack was a threshold. In a terrorist attack, it is the nature of the attack and the success the terrorists are able to achieve-sometimes what happens is that the terrorists get success because of incidental damage caused. Uri, for example, was an incidental success because there were troops in tents, troops who were grouped together. In Nagrota, they did not get so much success, they did not get so many people, we were able to eliminate them before they could do damage. So the threshold level will vary and [determine] the kind of reaction, because our nation is not a warmongering nation. We want peace and tranquility, and if we find that something can be resolved through negotiations, an attempt is always made to resolve it through negotiations but if we find these incidents getting repeated, we define a threshold, a decision is taken, recommendations are made, and we will go across again. It is very difficult to say if there are red lines (in response to terrorist attacks). What I can say is that there are dotted lines, and those dots are then joined together by us to draw a red line.Is the Cold Start doctrine-instituted after Operation Parakram in 2001-still an option in response to attacks like the one on Parliament in 2001 or 26/11 in Mumbai?The Cold Start doctrine exists for conventional military operations. Whether we have to conduct conventional operations for such strikes is a decision well-thought through, involving the government and the Cabinet Committee on Security.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had, in the combined commanders' conference in 2015, said that future conflicts will become shorter, and wars will become rare. Do you have any strategy for short, intense wars?In our case, we prepare for short, intense conflicts, and at the same time have to be prepared for wars becoming long-drawn. Based on that, we have a well-defined strategy. What the PM said is right; wars will be intense and short because there'll always be international pressure in wars between two nations. We have to be aware of that; whatever action we take, therefore, has to be quick; forces have to be ready and have to achieve success.The modernisation of the Indian Army has been an area of major concern for you and your predecessors. Have you identified any key areas for delivery during your tenure?Technology is constantly changing. You cannot be using older technologies for your weapons systems and equipment. My thinking is that you have to look at emerging technology because of the time it takes for a weapons system to be inducted into the armed forces. So you have to look at tomorrow's technology for inducting weapons. With that in mind, we have also focused on certain weapons systems. Infantry is the most affected-deployed along the border round the clock, in internal security situations, and in the face of frequent ceasefire violations on the border-we need to give them modern weapons technology best suited to such an environment. The mechanised forces need future battle tanks and Infantry Combat Vehicles, new aviation assets, air defence systems, artillery and other longer ranged weapon systems that have more lethality and accuracy. We are also looking at upgrading operational logistics systems. The modernisation priorities have been spelt out by my predecessor [Gen. Dalbir Singh] and we are continuing with the same vision and thrust areas because I feel they have been thought through and holistically define the army's requirements.Do you see an emerging threat in the new China-Pakistan proximity and how do you propose to respond to it?National security strategy by any nation is defined by its national interests. China has defined its national interests by coming close to Pakistan in looking for access to the Indian Ocean Region, for energy security, trade. Today, economics defines national strategy and wherever people find economic gain, there are cooperative mechanisms and alliances. We also have to look at our national interests and continue doing whatever is best in our national interests. We will also counter such mechanisms through our own means; our government is quite capable of handling [these]. We are also carrying out actions to negate the nexus developing between China and Pakistan.Would you elaborate on these measures?We are addressing the neighbourhood, the extended neighborhood and the Far West. We are looking at certain countries on China's eastern seaboard, and the Americas. There are groupings that are taking place. While we are proud of being non-aligned, there are times when you have to get into some groupings, which is of course in the domain of foreign policy, so I wouldn't like to really comment. We have masters in foreign policy and they do it really well. Our diplomacy is moving well, the prime minister's focus is on the global arena, we will be able to counter whatever is happening through our foreign policy.What are your expectations from a closer military partnership with the United States?Our expectations are that we must live like friends - the economic partnership will grow stronger and everything else will fall into place. We are sharing expertise but that is more in the field of humanitarian assistance and disaster response. We do try out some joint training as far as counter-insurgency [is concerned]. The US does consider us a lead nation in Counter Insurgency Ops; they have specialisation in special forces operations which we look at. As for equipment, we have a system of global tendering, and I feel we should go for whoever gives us the best. Finally, we should support our domestic industry. What it will depend on is who is willing to come here, share technology and help our domestic industry grow and help us in becoming self-reliant, so we needn't be country-fixated.We have been hearing a lot about the rivalry between the infantry and the armoured corps. Would you set the record straight on this?","Newly-appointed Army Chief General Bipin Rawat has said that the Indian forces would cross the border again if peace and tranquility are not maintained after attempting to resolve things through negotiations.

It further said that they ""couldn't share this experience with anyone because of the fear that no one will believe"", given his celebrity status.This post was taken down less than an hour later.

Here is our Running Shaadi movie review.Running Shaadi Cast: Amit Sadh, Taapsee Pannu, Arsh BajwaRunning Shaadi Direction: Amit RoyRunning Shaadi Rating: (3/5)Running Shaadi, previously known as Runningshaadi.com but not anymore because Shaadi.com approached Bombay High Court protesting against the title, is a film that is great in patches but is mostly just about okay.The story of Running Shaadi involves Ram Bharose (Amit Sadh) and Nimmi (Taapsee Pannu), a boy and girl who grow up together in Punjab and after a fallout with his boss, Ram joins hands with his friend 'Cyberjeet' (the excellent Arsh Bajwa) to start a website called Runningshaadi.com that organises all that an everyday eloping couple from India would need. Nimmi joins the duo but soon enough, the romantic tension between her and Ram takes the story through unexpected turns.MOVIE REVIEW: THE GHAZI ATTACKWatch Running Shaadi trailer here:Running Shaadi was ready two years ago, but the distributors could never find a suitable window to release it. That is unfortunate because within those two years, films like Dolly Ki Doli and Happy Bhag Jayegi released. As such, conceptually, the film seems dated. While watching the film, you would get shades of Band Baaja Baaraat (two unlikely small-towners getting together to become entrepreneurs), and of course, the aforementioned films because there's the entire 'runaway bride' angle.Nevertheless, there is a lot that works for Running Shaadi. And that 'lot' is pretty much the excellent casting.Amit Sadh as the ambitious and resourceful Ram Bharose gives a career-defining performance as the lead. He is what they call 'lambi race ka ghoda.' Amit gets to showcase a range of emotions in Running Shaadi and he never, ever falters. He is so good. Hopefully, he gets noticed in Running Shaadi for all his worth.Then, there's Arsh Bajwa as the goofy but smart tech geek Sarabjeet AKA Cyberjeet. The scenes of him worshipping Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg and that funny-for-a-while red turban with the image of a Facebook 'Like' button on it seem forced but that does not take away from Arsh's grade-A supporting act.Taapsee Pannu gets a very tricky, complicated character, Nimmi. Nimmi is the kind of girl who you will never want to make a team-member if you have to rob a bank. She cons Ram Bharose in the most unexpected manner right before the interval and one will be hard-pressed to sympathise or empathise with her. However, Ram, who has been established as a 'sorted' dude, for some reason, continues to willingly jump into near-fatal situations for her. Is love a good enough reason to justify unconvincing character development?Watch 'Mannerless Majnu' from Running Shaadi:Three entire paragraphs are devoted to the film's actors because that is how much they hold the story together. Because without them, the plot falls apart. Running Shaadi is made of an err...running chain of unbelievable plot twists but we will suspend our disbelief simply because of the strength of its actors.Debutant director Amit Roy, who has previously been a cinematographer for Ram Gopal Varma's very uniquely-shot movies such as the Sarkar films, Nishabd and Rann, has the potential to make a great second film. Running Shaadi on paper seems trite, but it is consistently engaging because newer and wilder plot developments get thrown at you (Roy is also the writer) and you cannot help but continue to run with its characters to find out what eventually becomes of them.In a week packed with multiple Bollywood and Hollywood releases, will Running Shaadi get noticed, more so, by the right people? An extra star for Amit, Taapse and Arsh.(The writer tweets as @devarsighosh.)","The Taapsee Pannu and Amit Sadh starrer 'Running Shaadi', which released on Friday, ""is great in patches..."", wrote India Today.

Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also directed the police to review the arms and ammunition licences to check unbridled proliferation of arms in the hands of criminals. The decision was taken at a high-level security review meeting chaired by Amarinder and attended by Punjab Director General of Police (DGP) Suresh Arora and Additional Director General of Police (Intelligence) Dinkar Gupta, besides Chief Principal Secretary Suresh Kumar. The withdrawal of security also includes pruning of the chief ministers security from 1,392 to 1,016 personnel. Some 1,500-odd security personnel have been withdrawn in other categories of constitutional and government functionaries, an official spokesperson said after the meeting. The chief minister has already ordered withdrawal of all deployment along his travel routes and his security is likely to be cut down further at the next review meeting, based on fresh reports on threat perceptions. Amarinder has made it clear that he does not want security beyond the ""bare necessity"". He has also directed the police and other agencies to review the existing security policy, which was approved by the Punjab cabinet and subsequently notified by the Department of Home Affairs and Justice in 2013. The chief minister underlined the need to provide only ""need-based"" security, taking the latest threat perception for individuals into account. With the existing security policy being three-year-old, he directed the police to call for fresh reports from the state and central agencies to map the threat perceptions of individuals who have been provided security and then decide on the quantum of security. This was the second security review meeting of the Amarinder-led Congress government since it took over the reins of Punjab last month. At the first meeting in March of a committee headed by the DGP (Law-and-Order), as many as 749 police and paramilitary personnel were withdrawn from various categories of protectees. The Congress manifesto for the Punjab Assembly polls had clearly stated that the ""unhealthy"" trend of the use of policemen by politicians and bureaucrats for their personal security will be discouraged strongly. Amarinder expressed grave concern at the threat posed to internal security as a result of arms proliferation, which had led to several incidents of law-and-order violation in the state. He ordered a comprehensive review of all the arms licences issued by district magistrates and police commissionerates. Amarinder also directed a propriety audit of the arms licences issued after the notification of the Arms Rules, 2016, which came into effect from July 15, 2016. ","The Punjab government on Friday slashed the VIP security, including that of the Chief Minister, by withdrawing nearly 2,000 personnel. CM Amarinder Singh's security has been reduced from 1,392 to 1,016 personnel. As per the government, the security has been cut down to create the necessary infrastructure for better policing.","Punjab has cut down on VIP security, including that of the Chief Minister, by 2,000 personnel and decided to deploy them to ensure better policing and improve the law-and-order situation in the state.

The fact that Donald Trump and Theresa May are holding a joint press conference is something of a surprise. Earlier this week Number 10 sources were playing down the prospect of such an event happening.Prime ministers and presidents often hold press conferences when they meet, but not always. Theresa May herself is not very keen on opening herself up to questioning in this way. And Trump himself thinks that journalists are ?among the most dishonest human beings on the earth.?

Clive Lewis has shifted his stance on article 50 quite considerably over the last seven days. A week ago he told his local paper, the Eastern Daily Press, that he could not vote for an article 50 bill on the basis of the government?s current plans. He told the paper:It is safe to say that I am deeply concerned at the direction that Theresa May and the Conservative government is taking these negotiations, and the developments that are taking place. I am very mindful of what the majority of constituents in Norwich South voted for, which is remain. I don?t think what is currently on the table, given the irreversibility of article 50, means that signing article 50 under these conditions is in the best interests of people in Norwich or the country. However it is the job of the opposition to see what we can get between now and March 31 in terms of assurances and guarantees and I think that will be critical to many people when they come to make their decision on this vote.Within the last week the government has announced it will publish a white paper about its plans.

Lewis said:I have been clear throughout that I respect the result of the referendum and will, therefore, join my colleagues in voting for the bill on its second reading. However, Theresa May does not have a mandate to dictate the terms of Brexit without listening to the British people. The whole country should be involved in determining our shared future, which is why Labour has fought for the British people to have a say, through parliament.Labour will seek to amend the bill to prevent the government using Brexit to trash our rights, public services, jobs and living standards while cutting taxes for the wealthiest.

Krishna Chinthapalli, a neurology registrar at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, had said an increasing number of hospitals could be shut down by ransomeware attacks in an article on the vulnerability of the NHS network in the British Medical Journal on Wednesday, two days before the major cyber hack of the National Health Service (NHS) system on Friday. He had highlighted an incident at Papworth Hospital near Cambridge where a nurse clicked on a malicious link and malware infected her computer and started to encrypt sensitive files. ""Fortunately, the hospitals daily data backup had just been completed. The IT director admitted that they were very lucky, saying, Timing absolutely was everything for us,"" Chinthapalli wrote. ""We should be prepared: more hospitals will almost certainly be shut down by ransomware this year,"" he wrote. The revelation came as UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd confirmed today that as many as 48 NHS trusts had been affected by the large-scale cyber-hack by an international criminal gang wreaked havoc around the country. After chairing an emergency meeting of the COBRA committee, Rudd said that all but 6 trusts were now back to normal. Confirming that 97 per cent of hospitals were ""back to normal"", she said, ""This is a virus that attacked Windows platforms. The fact is the NHS has fallen victim to this."" The Opposition Liberal Democrat and Labour parties have both demanded an inquiry into the cyber-attack. Patients of the state-funded country-wide service are still facing days of chaos as appointments and surgeries were cancelled after NHS organisations from London to Scotland were hit in the ""ransomware"" attack yesterday. NHS Digital said the impact of the cyberattack could continue. ""The situation is changing and impacting organisations in a range of different ways,"" a spokesperson said. Ciaran Martin, who leads the UKs National Cyber Security Centre, said his team was doing everything in their power to get ""vital services"" back up and running. ""We are very aware that attacks on critical services such as the NHS have a massive impact on individuals and their families, and we are doing everything in our power to help them restore these vital services,"" he said. ""Its important to understand that cyber attacks can be different from other forms of crime in that their sometimes highly technical and anonymous nature means it can take some time to understand how it worked, who was behind it and what the impact is,"" he told the BBC. Critically ill patients are being diverted to unaffected hospitals as computer systems failed in A&E units and doctors were locked out of test results, X-rays and patient records. NHS England said patients needing emergency treatment should go to Accidents & Emergency (A&E) or access emergency services as they normally would. However, there have been some reports of ambulances being diverted from affected hospitals and individual NHS trusts have asked registered patients not to attend unless it is urgent. Londons Barts Health NHS Trust, the largest trust in the UK, cancelled all outpatient appointments at its five hospitals today. The NHS has not been affected in Wales and Northern Ireland. The assault is part of an attack that has affected organisations in more than 70 countries, including the United States, China, Russia and Spain, disrupting power and telephone companies. Gangs are thought to have used tools stolen from US spies and dumped online by hackers linked to Russia. ""This is not targeted at the NHS, its an international attack and a number of countries and organisations have been affected,"" British Prime Minister Theresa May said. ""The National Cyber Security Centre is working closely with NHS Digital to ensure they support the organisations concerned and that they protect patient safety. We are not aware of any evidence that patient data has been compromised,"" she said. The attack came after warnings of NHS vulnerability, with cybersecurity allegedly neglected despite a series of attempted hacks. Ransomware programmes, which are sent by email and spread swiftly, can be bought on the dark web with sellers negotiating a percentage of the takings. ""We will be advising NHS trusts to modernise their platforms,"" UK home secretary Amber Rudd said. The malware used in the NHS attack is called WannaCry and attacks Windows operating systems. It encrypts files on a users computer, blocking them from view, before demanding money, via an on-screen message, to access them again. The demand is for a payment of 300 dollars in virtual currency Bitcoin to unlock the files.

His system was refusing to take food even in liquid form. He had battled diseases earlier, but gave up the fight at 11.30pm yesterday (Tuesday),?

During the campaign he vowed to oversee construction of a ?big beautiful wall, with a big beautiful door? to let approved immigrants come into the United States.But on his way to Paris, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One: ?It?s a 2,000-mile border, but you don?t need 2,000 miles of wall because you have a lot of natural barriers. You have mountains. You have some rivers that are violent and vicious. You have some areas that are so far away that you don?t really have people crossing.?There are already about 650 miles (1,046 km) of fencing along the border, all of which is see-through.Trump?s remarks were informal and initially not allowed to be reported. The White House later provided a partial transcript of them.The Mexican border in much of Texas is defined by the Rio Grande, though parts of that river are little more than a trickle of water. About 24 miles (38 km) of the border in Arizona is marked by the Colorado river.Trump also said the wall ?needs transparency?.?You have to be able to see through it,? Trump said, adding that border agents need to know what or who is on the other side of the fence to avoid being hit by sacks of drugs and other contraband.?As horrible as it sounds, when they throw the large sacks of drugs over, and if you have people on the other side of the wall, you don?t see them. They hit you on the head with 60 pounds (27 kg) of stuff? It?s over,? Trump said.Drug smugglers have tried to fling bundles of drugs over parts of the roughly 650 miles of border that already has fencing or other barriers, using tactics including sling shots and catapults. But it?s unclear if anyone has ever been injured by the flying contraband.This year the government issued two notices for border wall proposals. The first called for a solid structure up to 30 ft (9.14 meters) high that couldn?t be easily breached. The second bid notice called for other types of walls, including something that could be seen through.Homeland security secretary John Kelly has said that border agents need to be able to see what is on the other side of a barrier for security and safety reasons. He has repeatedly said that Trump?s proposed wall would not be ?sea to shining sea?, from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Gulf of Mexico in the east.","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that his proposed wall along the US-Mexico border will need to be transparent so that people on the US side do not get hit by massive sacks of drugs being tossed over it.

The Xperia XZ Premium is undoubtedly the company's most exciting device in years and comes with a range of breakthrough features, the chief amongst them being the world's first 4K HDR display in a smartphone. Unlike the LG G6, which has eschewed Qualcomm's latest processor - the Snapdragon 835 in favour of the older Snapdragon 821 in order to gain the first mover advantage over the Galaxy S8, Sony has decided to stick with the 835 for the XZ Premium.The catch here is the fact that the XZ Premium will not be out before Spring, which is quite some time away. Additionally, the smartphone comes with 4GB of RAM, a 3,230mAh battery with QuickCharge 3.0 support and Android 7.0 out of the box. As with previous Xperia's, the power button doubles up as a fingerprint scanner. Also Read:  Nokia 3310 relaunched: What is its price and other questions answeredTouted as a 'game-changing camera', the Sony Xperia XZ Premium comes with an entirely new camera system called the 'Motion Eye' which comes with the world's first memory stacked sensor. Sony has embedded fast memory right into the camera stack which allows the smartphone to capture video at an astonishing 960 frames per second, which is 4 times slower than any other smartphone available today. Sony claims that the ' World's fastest image capture technology in a smartphone' allows the camera to capture instances that occur in the blink of an eye and reveal things beyond what the human vision is capable of seeing. The added memory also brings with it improved predictive capture in the XZ Premium. The device starts to buffer images the moment it detects motion and selects 4 of the best photos by analysing the speed of the moving object.Additionally, the XZ Premium also comes with the same triple-sensor system found in the Xperia XZ, although the sensor's resolution has been reduced slightly to 19 megapixels. It has an aperture of f/2.0 and comes with SteadyShot and an 'Anti-distortion' shutter. On the front, there is a 13MP camera with an aperture of f/2.0 for selfies.Along with the camera, the display is what sets the XZ Premium apart from the competition. It is the first smartphone in the world to come with a 4K HDR display which is 5.5' in size and is also 40% brighter than the Xperia Z5 Premium's panel.The problem with the Xperia Z5 Premium was the fact that there was little or no 4K content available to enjoy on the smartphone. To remedy this, Sony has entered into a partnership with Amazon Prime Video where users will be able to enjoy a selection of 4K HDR content on their smartphones.Lastly, Sony has entered into a partnership with Qualcomm in order to create a new class of devices that are capable of gigabit LTE speeds.

They said: ?All you get is academic textbooks to read. Anyone expecting a hands-on approach would be disappointed.

After protesting, the trainee ended up without her last month of pay, or about £1,200.?I think they knew I was vulnerable as I started as a graduate,? the trainee said. The trainee sought a new job after finding they were being used to ?fill HR gaps? rather than being given roles suitable to her training.Capita said that it now charged £13,000 to trainees who wanted to leave before completing their training and two years of work. It said it had previously charged different rates depending on the role involved.A spokesperson said: ?All participants in the training are made fully aware, at numerous times prior to commencing the training, that it is provided free of charge to only those people who successfully complete the course and are engaged by Capita or a Capita client. Those who successfully complete the training but cannot be found a role within 90 days also receive the training free of charge.?Further revelations about the Capita scheme come as it emerges that one of Capita?s rivals, FDM Group, a FTSE-listed company which works with the Home Office and Ministry of Justice, also demands graduates sign up to months of unpaid training in order to secure jobs.The group?s graduate programme includes up to 14 weeks of unpaid training, after which it says 99% of attendees are placed in a job.The company also demands that trainees pay up to £20,000 if they leave during the training or the first two years of work.A spokeswoman for FDM said: ?The professional training we provide is a major financial investment in our people and in line with employers who invest in their people, we have clauses in our contracts that look to recoup the cost of training with a cap of £20,000 if a person leaves during training or the first two years of consulting. We have a commitment to transparency with all applicants to ensure that they understand the terms clearly. Trainees have 14 days from when they start training to trial the programme and leave with no fees charged.??We have a clear and unwavering commitment for all trainees and employees to be treated and compensated fairly and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Our employees receive a competitive graduate salary that far exceeds national minimum wage levels.?Individuals undertaking our bespoke training do not engage in any work or provide any services for us or any of our clients until they have successfully completed their training, passed all relevant internal and external examinations and been assessed as ready for the workplace.?","Capita, one of the UK?s largest outsourcing companies, has demanded up to £21,000 (?17.7 lakh) from graduates who tried to leave an unpaid training scheme. Former trainees said the training lacked any on-the-job experience and called it ?absolutely useless?. Capita has said participants were made fully aware that free training is provided to only those who successfully complete the course.","UK outsourcing company Capita has demanded payouts of up to £21,000 from graduates who tried to pull out of an unpaid training scheme under which they were not guaranteed a job. The company, which provides services ranging from electronic tagging of offenders to store card services for retailers, has been criticised for advertising a number of roles in its IT resourcing division."

The latest victim of their scissors is Nawazuddin Siddiqui-starrer Babumoshai Bandookbaaz. The Pahlaj Nihalani-led board ordered a whopping 48 cuts to the film, and when India Today Television reached out to him, he said, ""We are just doing our job.""But this is not the worst of it. Disparaging sexist comments were allegedly made by CBFC members about the producer, Kiran Shroff, for green-lighting a film with such 'abusive' content. According to a report in Bombay Times, a female member asked her how she, as a woman, could be involved in the making of a film with so many abuses. At this point, a male member is said to have interjected, ""Inhone to pant-shirt pehni hai. Yeh aurat thodi hi hain.""Kiran told the publication, ""They had an internal discussion for an hour after the screening. First, they told us that they were giving us an A certificate. Then they told us that there are 48 cuts. We argued that if the film is for adults, then why have so many cuts. They didn't bother much, and continued to explain each cut and their logic behind it.""She added, ""In the middle of that, a lady officer turned to me and said, 'Aap aurat hokar aisi filmein kaise bana sakti hain'. And before I could speak up, a man in the committee said, 'But she is not a woman. Look at what she is wearing.' I was dumbfounded. This is such a regressive thought... Sadly, this is the kind of humiliation producers have to put up with. If they are judging me by my clothes, I can imagine the parameters they must have used to pass my film.""Babumoshai Bandookbaaz has been directed to do away with abusive words as well as 80 per cent of its ""humping"" scenes. Director Kushan Nandy was appalled and told the daily, ""First and foremost, we don't have humping scenes. They are love-making scenes. I am shocked and appalled with what has happened. If you notice the cuts, there's a sentence, 'Yeh kaahe ka c******a hai'. We use such sentences in our everyday life. The excuse given to us is that children also sneak into cinema halls to watch adult films. How is that my problem? Penalise the cinema halls for this, not the producers. The way they have dealt with our film is insulting. They humiliated Kiran which is unpardonable.""Apparently, the filmmaker has been asked to get rid of a bunch of sentences with the word ""khada"" in it. He met Pahlaj Nihalani in private to discuss the directives, but the CBFC chief had a shocking response - ""You are lucky I'm not banning your film.""Kushan said, ""When I argued that there are no grounds to do that, he retorted, 'What are these abuses? Do you plan to make a dictionary of bad words?' He even asked me to change lines like 'Maa ka lehenga' to 'Maa ka anchal'. In short, the essence of what is being said is lost. He told me, 'C*****a ko tutiya kar do.' He is basically trying to teach us to make a film. And finally, he told me to remove the line that has 'Khada' in it. He said, 'I will never let it pass because I am abused for my song Khada Hai Khada Hai to this day.' I'll fight this till the end.""Pahlaj Nihalani refused to comment on the matter.At a media interaction today, Kiran Shroff shared all that the CBFC members told her.

His publicist told Variety that the cause of death was ?cancer complications?.The Silence of the Lambs, the horror-thriller adapted from Thomas Harris? novel, was the high point of his career as a mainstream film-maker: the film won five Oscars, including best director for Demme, and made its central character, Hannibal Lecter, into a household name.However, it was untypical of Demme?s career, both before and after its 1991 release. Having spent much of the 1960s living in London and working as a music writer, Demme cut his teeth in the no-budget school of Roger Corman: initially as a writer, then gaining his first directorial credit on the prison flick Caged Heat in 1974. (Its tag line: ?Women?s prison USA ? Rape Riot and Revenge! White Hot Desires melting cold prison steel!)After directing two other films for Corman, Demme found a niche in the burgeoning independent cinema scene with his 1980 film Melvin and Howard, a comedy about a former milkman who claims to be the heir of Howard Hughes. Later in the same decade, Demme completed the yuppie-in-peril comedy Something Wild, which gave Melanie Griffith one of her early successful roles.The Silence of the Lambs, he said later, ?was a great delirious shock to everybody concerned?, but he appeared to being disquieted by the controversies that accompanied it, and subsequently concentrated on films that reflected his own politically liberal credentials. Philadelphia, which starred Tom Hanks in an Oscar-winning performance and brought Aids and gay characters into the mainstream. Meanwhile, Beloved, released in 1998, was an adaptation of Toni Morrison?s seminal novel about slavery.Alongside his feature film career, Demme indulged a taste for the odd, the eccentric and the underground. He made documentaries about Talking Heads (including Stop Making Sense, 1984), Neil Young (among them Heart of Gold, 2006) and his radical priest cousin (Cousin Bobby, 1992); he filmed Spalding Gray?s celebrated one-man show Swimming to Cambodia (1987), and shot a profile of US president Jimmy Carter (Man from Plains, 2007).His mainstream film-making took a dip in the 2000s, after the poorly received remake of Charade, The Truth About Charlie and a new version of The Manchurian Candidate, but he restored his reputation with the wedding comedy-drama Rachel Getting Married and the likable girl-rocker film Ricki and the Flash.Jodie Foster, who won an Oscar for her role in The Silence of the Lambs, released a statement earlier today. ?I am heart-broken to lose a friend, a mentor, a guy so singular and dynamic you?d have to design a hurricane to contain him,? it read. ?Jonathan was as quirky as his comedies and as deep as his dramas.

Convict Afzal Guru hanged inside Tihar jail. The identity of the executioner: Classified. Was a hangman brought from another state? Or was it a jail staff who tied the noose? It remains a secret because there is not a single hangman in India?s largest prison . According to available records, there was never one. The prison in west Delhi has 19 prisoners on death row -- the highest to date. The 19 include the four convicts in the 2012 December gang rape case whose conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court in May. Prison officials said though there is a post of an executioner in the prison manual ever since its construction in the mid 1950s, jail records do not show any name who has worked as one. Over the past years, the jail has received letters from the public offering to be executioners. After the December 16 verdict by the lower court, they had received calls from the public. ?We received 2-3 letters from citizens offering their services to kill convicts on the death row. They were residents of a Meerut village, the same place where a hangman employed at a UP jail lives. They were aware that Tihar does not have a hangman and were willing to do the job,? said an official.According to jail rules, any person who is mentally sound is eligible to be an executor. ?Any jail officer can be the executor. In 1989, we had used the services of a hangman from Meerut jail. It was the execution of Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh, killers of former prime minister Indira Gandhi. He was officially paid Rs 200,? said a jail officer. According to rules, the allowance for one hanging is two hundred rupees. Sunil Gupta, who served as the law officer in Tihar for three decades, told HT that an executioner?s role is not a positive one. ?A prison is a place for reform. Having an executioner kind of kills the purpose. At Tihar, we believe that prisoners spend time so that they can be reformed.? Gupta said another reason why the jail did not have a hangman was because the man would have no job. From 1989 till 2013, there was no execution. ?If there were a salaried man, he would be getting paid for no work.? ","India's biggest prison, Tihar jail, does not have a hangman on its payroll, according to reports.

A day earlier, the boy had disclosed that the accused, Dinesh, who ran a barber shop, had committed ?galat kaam? (wrong act) with him during several occasions for one week and had threatened him not to disclose it to anyone. An FIR was registered at Krishna Nagar police station and Dinesh was arrested. The court noted that the mental condition of the child victim was weak at the time of the crime. When his statement was recorded, the boy was answering the questions very slowly. He was even not able to tell the exact time in the watch. The boy?s father told the court that his 14-year-old son had the mentality ability of a class 2 student though he was studying in class 5 at the time of the incident. The school authorities also deposed that the boy was a slow learner and cannot cope up with normal school syllabus as he had an intelligence quotient below average. The court noted that the boy preferred to tell about the act and conduct of the accused first to a doctor near his house instead of his family members. ?This behaviour points out that he was not fully capable to think and to take a wise decision about what is wrong or what is right for him and to whom he should rely upon and keep faith. This also clearly leads to the conclusion that victim was somehow a mentally weak child at the commission of the offence,? the court said in its judgment.Dinesh had pleaded not guilty. He claimed he had been falsely implicated in the case. Dinesh said the boy had gone to his shop twice for a hair cut but did not pay money and urinated there.  So he had told the boy that he would beat him up if he came again. The boy in his cross examination in the court admitted that he used to throw articles such as combs and scissors on Dinesh whenever he visited his shop. But the court held that this act of the boy did not mean Dinesh could commit a serious and heinous offence by taking advantage of his mentally weak situation. The court said the boy was telling the truth and his statement could be relied upon being trustworthy. It held Dinesh guilty under section 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. It also directed the Delhi Legal Service Authority (East) to pay a compensation of R 50,000 to the boy for the mental torture.

He retired to Panchgani, a mountain resort near Poona (now Pune), where he stayed at Dilkhush Bungalow.?A group of 18 or 20 men reached Panchgani by a chartered bus from Poona and held a day-long protest against Gandhi. When Gandhi was told about this, he contacted the leader of the group, Nathuram Vinayak Godse, for a discussion. Nathuram rejected the invitation and continued with his demonstration,? the book says.?During a prayer meeting that evening, Nathuram Godse, dressed in a Nehru shirt, pajama and jacket, rushed towards Gandhi. He was brandishing a dagger in his hand and shouting anti-Gandhi slogans. Godse was overpowered by Manishankar Purohit, the proprietor of the Surti lodge of Poona, and D Bhilare Guruji of Satara, who later became a Congress legislator from Mahabaleshwar. The other youth accompanying Godse ran away,? it saidIn 2008, at an event in Mumbai, Bhilare was lauded for having had the presence of mind and the daring to twist the knife out of Nathuram Godse?s hand as he rushed to kill Gandhiji in a frenzy.In 1944, Bhilare was the taluka pramukh of the Rashtra Seva Dal.?It was a wet July evening in Panchgani in 1944,? Bhilare Guruji had recalled at the event.?All of us had assembled in the Batha High School hall for the evening prayers when suddenly a door opposite me opened and in rushed Nathuram Godse. He was wielding a knife and muttering incoherently.?Bhilare blocked his path and twisted the knife out of his hand.?My colleagues in the Seva Dal were also quick to react, and threw him out of the premises,? he had recalled.Bhilare had also claimed that Gopal Godse and Narayan Apte, who were implicated in the Mahatma?s assassination, were present at the spot.The Panchgani incident has been documented in the memoirs of Gandhiji?s close associate, said Pyarelal, a functionary of Mani Bhawan in Mumbai from where Mahatma Gandhi initiated satyagraha and propagated the cause of swadeshi.

But this time, she was left high and dry by India's sports authorities.Nagpur-based Kanchanmala, who is completely sightless and swims in the S11 category, had to face extreme misery during her trip to Berlin because of alleged slip-ups by the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI).She and five others participating in the Para Swimming Championships in the German capital from July 3-9 had a harrowing time as the government money sanctioned for their tour did not reach them.In the end, Kanchanmala had to beg and borrow money in an unfamiliar city. The PCI, however, has blamed the Sports Authority of India for the lapse.But the situation failed to deter the athletes' fierce determination. Despite all odds, Kanchanmala and Suyash Jadhav won silver medals and qualified for the World Championships.Kanchanmala, 26, beat the qualifying mark in 100m Freestyle (1:34:00), 100m Backstroke (1:41:00), 100m Breaststroke (2:01:00) and 200m Individual Medley (3:03:00), in which she also picked up a silver medal. She became the only female swimmer from India to qualify for the World Para Swimming Championships this year.The sportspersons have been inspired by India's remarkable show at the Rio Paralympics last year, where the country posted its best-ever performance by winning two golds, a silver and a bronze.'NEVER THOUGHT WOULD FACE SUCH PROBLEMS'Kanchanmala and her escort Jaimala Pande were part of the Berlin contingent that was granted sponsorship by the government. However, the PCI failed to provide her the money and she was forced to bear her hotel and food expenses.""I never thought I would face such problems. I had to take a loan of Rs 5 lakh so that I could participate in the tournament. I had to qualify for the World Championships and I don't know why PCI didn't understand its importance,"" Kanchamala, who is also an assistant with the Reserve Bank of India in Nagpur, told Mail Today.""I was not given any official confirmation if I will receive a reimbursement for the expense I bore. I had to pay around Rs 70,000 for the hotel and more than Rs 40,000 for food. There was a time when I had no money left. I was simply devastated. Moreover, they put my name in 50m Backstroke when it was never my event. I had to write letters to the International Paralympic Committee when a coach was appointed to take care of the swimmers.""The swimmers were also asked to arrange their visas, which cost her additional Rs 15,000. To add to the misery, Kanchanmala, who won a bronze at the 2011 World Para Games, was shocked to see that the PCI had registered her in the 50m Backstroke event when she had actually applied for the 100m Backstroke.'HORROR SHOW'In her own words, Kanchanmala's Europe trip was no less than a ""horror show"". The coach Kanchanmala refers to is Kanwaljeet Singh, the man sent by the PCI to assist the para-swimmers.Singh was allegedly of almost no help, often going missing during the main events while also going to the extent of asking for 90 pounds (Rs 7,462) as participation fee.""He (Singh) didn't help me at all. I used to go back to the hotel just with my escort and god knows where he used to be. Once, I took a tram from the tournament venue to my hotel and I had no money. I had to travel without ticket and was caught by the checker who later fined me 120 pounds (about Rs 10,000),"" Kanchanmala said.""He (Singh) asked for participation fee from me when it should be PCI paying for all of this. Even though he paid the fee later, I had a very rough time with him. A coach should be helpful and always take care of athletes. I didn't see any of that.""BLAME GAMEHowever, PCI vice-president Gurucharan Singh maintained that the Sports Authority of India (SAI) had not sanctioned the amount for the tournament while also saying that the swimmers will be refunded their money.""We are facing problems from with SAI regarding sanction of amount for championships. The money for swimming championship in Berlin didn't come on time and as the process takes around 3-4 days, we weren't able to provide it to the swimmers,"" he said.""I am here in London for the World Athletics Championship and we are also facing a problem of shortage of money. SAI sanctioned just 40,000 pounds (Rs 33.16 lakh) while the organisers are asking for 80,000 pounds (Rs 66.32 lakh). We will hold meetings with SAI officials to discuss this matter. So, a fix to all this will be done once the London meet is over. I assure you, the swimmers will be given back their money. As for the coach problem, I am not aware of it. As soon as I get back to India, we will talk to the swimmers and will carry out an inquiry if needed.""Despite the frustrations, Kanchanmala fulfilled her dream to qualify for her second World Championship and wants to put all this behind as she aims for more glory in the September meet.","Indian para-swimmer Kanchanmala Pande, who is completely blind, won a silver at the Para Swimming Championships in Germany after borrowing money to participate. Kanchanmala, who took a loan of ?5 lakh after money sanctioned by the government did not reach her, also qualified for the World Championships with the win.

Then on Tuesday morning Trump will meet Abbas in Bethlehem before flying on to Rome.Speaking at his weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, ahead of Trump?s arrival, Netanyahu said: ?I will discuss with President Trump ways to strengthen our primary and steadfast ties with the United States. We will improve our security ties, which we are strengthening on a daily basis. We will also discuss ways to advance the peace.?The visit will take place under tight security with about 10,000 police securing the Israeli part of the visit, which will be accompanied by road closures. Trump will spend a single night in a suite in the King David hotel protected by glass capable of withstanding a rocket-propelled grenade and a poison gas attack. The visit comes at a tense time ahead of the 50th anniversary of the Six Day War in early June ? which for Palestinians marks five decades of occupation ? and amid a continuing hunger strike by hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails that has prompted sometimes violent demonstrations on the West Bank.Trump?s problems at home are also seen by some as having cast a pall over the proceedings, with Dan Shapiro, the former US ambassador to Israel under Barack Obama, predicting: ?I think the trip?s in a lot of jeopardy [in] being able to be productive because of all the chaos and controversy that?s going on in Washington.? Despite the signs posted in Jerusalem neighbourhoods welcoming Trump as ?a friend of Zion? and calling on hims to ?make Israel great?, his visit is also causing anxieties for many on Israel?s right for whom Trump?s election was seen initially as the cause for unbridled celebration. Since his inauguration on 20 January, those same rightwingers fear that Trump has drifted towards an ever more conventional US foreign policy position on the peace process.Far from moving the US embassy to Jerusalem on his first day in office ? as he promised ? Trump has kicked that issue into the long grass while expressing a sometimes garbled objection to Israeli settlement building.That has seen David Friedman, the controversial and pro-settler new US ambassador to Israel who arrived last week, move quickly to reassure Netanyahu?s government that Trump remains as firmly committed to Israel as ever, even as he suggested that no announcement on the US embassy would be made until after Trump?s visit.The messaging on the Israel-Palestine peace process has also been downbeat, with one US official telling Haaretz on Sunday that the height of Trump?s ambitions for his ?ultimate deal? right now appears to involve no more than encouraging the two sides to play nicely to create conditions for direct talks.?The president has made a general statement regarding his view on settlements and he hopes the Israeli government takes it into account,? the official said. ?He was also pretty direct with President Abbas regarding what they need to do regarding incitement and the payments to families of terrorists. He has been quite clear about that and he will be clear about that during the visit.?Instead, the expectation will be that Trump will neither outline a vision for a framework for the peace process nor any concrete steps. What noises that have emerged from reported leaks about Trump?s plans to advance peace suggest an implausible mishmash of ideas ? including the idea that Israel be allowed to continue settlement building during talks.On the Israeli side the most significant outcome is a proposal for improving the economic quality of life for Palestinians on the West Bank, including longer opening hours for the Allenby Bridge crossing to Jordan, more building permits in the so-called area C and suggestions for new industrial zones on the West Bank.Lacking any clear prospects for a breakthrough, the runup to the visit has been dominated by mini ? and sometimes concocted ? controversies including the comment by a US official telling Netanyahu?s office that the Western Wall was not in Israeli territory.Trump will, however, become the first US president to visit the wall, a fact that was being spun last week by Jonathan Schanzer of the rightwing US Foundation for Defence of Democracies as a pro-Israel step.?I think that if Trump himself goes to the Western Wall and does it with Israeli officials, even Israeli security, there?s going to be very little argument over who controls it ? certainly [when] going there to acknowledge it as a Jewish holy site,? said Schanzer.On the Palestinian side, officials appear content that the worst predictions regarding Trump on the Middle East ? fuelled by his own campaign rhetoric ? have not materialised. ?We?re happy that, contrary to initial expectations, the Trump administration has been willing to listen,? one official said. ?Our readout is that Trump was surprised by Abbas?s declaration of his willingness to make peace, having being told the opposite by some of his advisers.?","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday ordered his cabinet to attend a welcome ceremony for US President Donald Trump, after discovering that many of them planned to skip the event, reports said. Notably, Israeli officials have criticised the visit as ""haphazard"". Trump arrived in Israel on Monday in the second leg of his first overseas trip as President.

Researchers from The University of Texas at Austin in the US conducted experiments with nearly 800 smartphone users to measure, for the first time, how well people can complete tasks when they have their smartphones nearby even when they are not using them. In one experiment, the researchers asked study participants to sit at a computer and take a series of tests that required full concentration in order to score well. The tests were geared to measure participants available cognitive capacity - that is, the brains ability to hold and process data at any given time. Before beginning, participants were randomly instructed to place their smartphones either on the desk face down, in their pocket or personal bag, or in another room. All participants were instructed to turn their phones to silent. The researchers found that participants with their phones in another room significantly outperformed those with their phones on the desk, and they also slightly outperformed those participants who had kept their phones in a pocket or bag. The findings suggest that the mere presence of ones smartphone reduces available cognitive capacity and impairs cognitive functioning, even though people feel they are giving their full attention and focus to the task at hand. ""We see a linear trend that suggests that as the smartphone becomes more noticeable, participants available cognitive capacity decreases,"" said Adrian Ward, Assistant Professor at University of Texas at Austin. ""Your conscious mind isnt thinking about your smartphone, but that process - the process of requiring yourself to not think about something - uses up some of your limited cognitive resources,"" Ward said. In another experiment, researchers looked at how a persons self-reported smartphone dependence - or how strongly a person feels he or she needs to have a smartphone in order to get through a typical day - affected cognitive capacity. Participants performed the same series of computer-based tests as the first group and were randomly assigned to keep their smartphones either in sight on the desk face up, in a pocket or bag, or in another room. In this experiment, some participants were also instructed to turn off their phones. The researchers found that participants who were the most dependent on their smartphones performed worse compared with their less-dependent peers, but only when they kept their smartphones on the desk or in their pocket or bag. ","A US-based study has found brain's cognitive abilities may be significantly reduced in the mere presence of smartphone, even if it's switched off. In a series of tests requiring concentration, participants with their phones in another room outperformed those with their phones on the desk, and also those who had kept their phones in a pocket or bag, researchers said.","Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin in the US conducted experiments with nearly 800 smartphone users to measure, for the first time, how well people can complete tasks when they have their smartphones nearby even when they are not using them. The researchers asked participants to sit at a computer and take tests that required full concentration in order to score well."

The Australian Cricket Board (ACB), which had kept the information secret for years, finally admitted that two of their cricketing icons Mark Waugh and Shane Warne had been paid to provide information to an Indian bookmaker during the Singer Cup in Sri Lanka in 1994. It was an enormous shock to the cricket community and beyond. The assumptions on which Australian cricket has been built were shattered.Inevitably the backlash has been severe. Australian Prime Minister John Howard expressed fury at ACB's coverup. Questions were asked in Parliament. Radio stations featured nothing else as callers vented their anger. Newspapers told the tale beneath soaring headlines on their front and back pages. Not in Australia's recent past has such emotion been aroused by a sporting event. The prosecution had turned into the defendant. People felt let down.The response in the subcontinent was quite the opposite. In Pakistan Salim Malik called it ""the happiest day of my life"". Warne and Waugh had claimed in 1995 that Malik had offered them $200,000 (Rs 85 lakh) to play poorly. Says Malik: ""Their allegations destroyed my career at a time when I was at my peak. Now I want to see what the International Cricket Council (ICC) and their board will do."" Indeed the Warne-Waugh issue raises several questions: why did the ACB cover it up and why did the ICC, which knew of the incident in 1995, choose to keep quiet?In India interest centred on the identity of the bookie. The Australians believed he was from Chennai and apparently named ""John"". Among Indians rumours pointed to a powerful Delhi-based bookie called Mukesh. What mattered more was: do Indian players also report on the weather? Technically, it is not match-fixing, yet giving out information on pitches (will it turn on the fourth day?) and match conditions is unethical. The Melbourne Age even quoted former Australian batsman Dean Jones as saying, ""There are 'moles' in every cricket team around the world ready to sell information to bookmakers."" Last year former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif had said several Indian players used to call him seeking such information.It is a startling coincidence that the Warne-Waugh episode has its roots in the 1994 Singer Cup. Manoj Prabhakar alleged that it was at this cup that a teammate offered him money to throw a match against Pakistan. Pakistani bookie Salim Pervez told Pakistan's Judicial Commission investigating match-fixing that he had handed Malik a briefcase with $100,000 (Rs 42.5 lakh) allegedly to fix the tournament's Pakistan-Australia match. And it was while the Singer matches were on that Waugh and Warne were approached.One unsubstantiated story has it that a man approached Warne, told him he was a great cricketer, gave him $5,000 (Rs 2.12 lakh) to spend at the gambling tables and later returned to genially ferret information. Whatever, this request for innocuous information on pitch and weather conditions is seen as a sweetener, the first step of a devious seduction. Warne and Waugh, both inveterate gamblers, took the bait for $5,000 and $6,000 (Rs 2.55 lakh) - less than their fines of $8,000 (Rs 3.4 lakh) and $10,000 (Rs 4.25 lakh) - unaware that they were being softened up for a later sting. Explains Ray: ""He denied it at first. And I said if you say that to me (deny it) on record then the matter is closed as far as I'm concerned. But Mark said 'I don't want to say anything' and that made me suspicious."" Still, Ray could not pin down the evidence.A month ago Malcolm Conn, another Australian journalist, picked up some rumours while covering the judicial inquiry in Lahore. Pursuing the story, he too met with a lot of brick walls and fabrications. Gradually other reporters started sniffing around and the ACB realised that suppression was no longer an option.Slowly the facts emerged over what happened. Alarmed by the original allegations about Malik's attempts to bribe their players and rattled by a phone call from Ray asking questions, senior ACB officials in 1995 instructed the Australian team manager Ian McDonald to find out whether any other payments had been offered or accepted. McDonald was with the team in New Zealand where he asked each player. It was then that Warne and Waugh admitted taking money from the bookmaker for giving out apparently routine information.Upon hearing these indiscretions, Graham Hablish, then ACB chief executive, and Alan Crompton, then ACB chairman, met the players in a hotel room near Sydney airport - the team was on its way to the Caribbean - imposed the fines of $10,000 and $8000 and promptly let the matter rest. Only after the team's departure was the rest of the ACB told of the fines. More pertinently, wrote Ray, ""The (board) meeting's minutes did not record any discussion of this serious matter.""As it happened the ICC's Sir Clyde Walcott and David Richards were in Sydney at the time and they were told about these breaches and sworn to secrecy. Incredibly the ICC allowed the cover-up to continue. As Richards argued in a press release last week, ""Historically each country has had the sole power and responsibility to deal with its own players on matters of discipline.""Mean while, the Pakistani board was attempting to come to grips with the scandals in its own backyard. Notwithstanding the diligent work of the judge leading the inquiry in Lahore and the courage of several Pakistani players in telling their side of the story neither the ACB nor the ICC thought it necessary to tell the inquiry commission that some of the Australian witnesses had been compromised. ","Former Australian cricketer Shane Warne, along with teammate Mark Waugh, was found guilty of accepting money from a bookmaker in 1994 in exchange of leaking information. The leg-spinner was also banned from international cricket for a year for failing a drug test before the 2003 World Cup. Warne later claimed the drug was given by his mother for weight loss.","Australian cricketers Mark Waugh and Shane Warne were paid to provide information to an Indian bookmaker during the Singer Cup in Sri Lanka in 1994. The ACB had kept the information secret for years, but it finally admitted that two of their cricketing icons had been paid to provide such information. Notably, Australia's recent past has not seen such emotion aroused by a sporting event."

Regarding CAG reports, Jaitley said that as per procedure, after tabling in Parliament, they go to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and if the latter makes some recommendations, then action would be taken.?If any action is to be taken, it will be taken,? Jaitley said in response to queries on whether any action would be taken against officials following observations in the CAG report.When a member wanted to know about the amount of ammunition required and other details, Jaitley said it is better in public interest not to make any such disclosure.Responding to queries, Minister of State for Defence Subhash Bhamre assured the House that no ordnance factory would be closed down and no one would be rendered unemployed.On strategic partnerships in the defence sector, Jaitley said it is intended to institutionalise a transparent, objective and functional mechanism to encourage broader participation of the private sector in the manufacture of defence platforms and equipment.Besides, the government has approved a proposal for manufacturing of ammunition for the Indian Army by the Indian industry, he said.In this regard, Jaitley said Request for Proposal (RFP) under open tender enquiry was issued in March.?Since the proposal is presently at RFP stage, grant of permission to any private company for manufacturing ammunition in parternship with foreign vendors/companies which have been blacklisted/banned for wrong doings/corrupt practices, does not arise,? the minister said.Further, Jaitley said the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP)/Defence Procurement Manual (DPM) contain provisions in standard clauses of contract for use of undue influence, including engagement of agents unauthorisedly by the seller.     ?DPP/DPM also provides for execution of a pre-contract integrity pact with the objective of ensuring that the procurement process is free from any wrongful business practice,? he added.

2017. Serena and Venus Williams in the women?s final, Roger Federer in the men?s with Rafael Nadal joining him if he beats Grigor Dimitov tomorrow. The veterans are dominating this Australian Open, although Dimitrov is playing well enough to pour cold water on all this romantic nostalgia.

Federer is asked about the possibility of meeting Rafael Nadal in the final for the first time in six years. ?It?s real now. I can actually talking about playing a finals for the first time. I?ve been dodging that bullet for the last couple of days. But this is the last one. I?ll leave it all out here in Australia and if I can?t walk for another five months, that?s ok. Rafa is the biggest challenge. This court allows me to be offensive. I?m probably his number one fan. We?ve had some epic battles over the years. It would be unreal to play here. I don?t think both of us though we were going to be here potentially playing in the final because I went to open his academy in Mallorca with him a few months back and I told him ?I wish we could do a charity match or something?, but I was on one leg and he had the wrist injury and we were playing some mini tennis with some juniors and we were like ?it?s the best we can do right now?. A few months later, we are maybe going to be in the finals. It?s a very special tournament for us already.?

Federer is asked about the possibility of playing Grigor Dimitrov in the final. ?He?s got a very complete game. He can mix it up very well. It?s either going to be him ... or Rafa.

More from Federer. ?I did feel he gave a bit of a cheap break. I didn?t really deserve it at that moment. But I served it out. Everything happened so quickly at the end.

Roger Federer speaks. ?Thank God. I thought he relaxed and I couldnt? serve as well I did. He let it go and it worked for him. It was hard to stop the bleeding and I was playing tight. Stan was playing nothing to lose. It was very tricky. Good tennis in the fifth. I?ve had a leg thing going on for the week and I felt it from the second game. I don?t know. I don?t really take injury timeouts, but Stan already took his so I thought people won?t be mad and Stan won?t be mad. That physio, he has magic hands. If you go off the court, that means the treatment is ... further ... up ... the ... leg.?

Stan Wawrinka leaves to a huge ovation from an appreciative crowd. What an effort it was from the world No4, who was in tears at the end of the second set. What heart he showed to fight back when he returned from a medical timeout with tape on his right knee. But there was no denying Federer in the end.

Federer makes a perfect start, a low forehand into the left corner forcing Wawrinka to hoist a backhand wide. Then he runs around a forehand, drilling it down the line to force an anguished Wawrinka to net his forehand for 30-0. Another big forehand is enough to make Wawrinka hit wide again and Federer has three match points. He misses a first serve. He sends the second to Wawrinka?s backhand and the world No4 sends his return long! That?s it! After missing most of last year with a knee injury Roger Federer has reached the Australian Open final at the age of 35! He embraces his vanquished opponent and close friend at the net before accepting the adulation from the crowd.Updated

Fifth set: Federer* 7-5, 6-3, 1-6, 4-6, 3-2 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Down 0-15, Federer responds well to win the next two points. Some effective serve and volley makes it 40-15. He hasn?t done that for a while. But at 40-30, Wawrinka hammers a forehand into the right corner to force deuce. Federer has to dig deep, but he?s putting nothing into his shots now and eventually nets a backhand to gift Wawrinka a break point. Now Wawrinka?s tight. He nets a backhand. It?s advantage Federer after he dominates the net and he does enough with a volley to force a sliding Wawrinka, who almost does the splits, to net a forehand. A vital hold.

Then, when Federer cracks a backhand from left to right, he nets a volley for 0-30. Wawrinka?s response is a second serve ace out wide. Oh, I say! Then Federer skews a forehand into the crowd to make it 30-all, before knocking a backhand return wide off a second serve. Wawrinka holds with a massive forehand down the line. Four points in a row and he holds and it was all thanks to that second serve ace at 0-30.

He can?t put away two smashes during the next rally and loses it when he nets a volley, before serving well for 30-15. The camera picks out Mirka, his wife, in mid-prayer. Does she know something we don?t? Wawrinka makes it 30-all with a superb return and then defends well, earning a break point when Federer nets a tentative backhand. Wawrinka has a look at a second serve and his return is outstanding. Federer hangs in there and it?s his turn to attack. Wawrinka?s defence is also good. Federer tries a drop shot. It?s not great, but Wawrinka pokes his backhand wide at the net and Federer goes on to hold. That could be huge. Federer breathes an almighty sigh of relief.

Andy, Stan and me are on first name terms!?I can see where you?re coming from, though Murray also has two Olympic titles and is the world No1. You can spin it either way.

That gives Wawrinka the encouragement to wallop a forehand into the right corner for a 0-30 lead. Federer tries to serve-volley, but Wawrinka opens up his racquet and guides a crosscourt forehand past him to earn three break points! Federer saves the first two with some stubborn serving. He approaches the net on the third. Federer volleys into the right corner, but Wawrinka moves smoothly, reaches down and flicks a forehand from right to left to break! He?ll serve for the fourth set!

Federer picks him off with a backhand down the line for 30-15, then smashes for 30-all. Suddenly it?s an awkward game for Wawrinka, who?s relieved to see a Federer backhand flash wide. Wawrinka nets a forehand, though, and the game goes to deuce, but he holds after a couple of staunch points.

Fourth set: Federer 7-5, 6-3, 1-6, 1-1 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka bangs an ace down for 15-0. Federer responds with a peach of a backhand pass from left to right for 15-all, which should make him feel a bit better about the way this has gone in the past 30 minutes. The game goes to 30-all and a baseline rally ensues. It ends with Wawrinka sending a backhand long and Federer has a break point. A brutally strong forehand from Wawrinka forces an error from Federer, whose forehand goes long for deuce. A double-fault from Wawrinka gifts Federer a second chance, though. Here?s another long rally. Federer?s in control, though, and there?s a hint of desperation about Wawrinka?s final shot, a backhand that drifts long. Federer breaks to stop the rot.

Fourth set: Federer* 7-5, 6-3, 1-6, 0-1 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Federer looks completely confused, a double-fault making it 15-30. The wind was taken out of his sails when Wawrinka went for that medical timeout and he hasn?t been able to handle the situation. Wawrinka?s loose. With nothing to lose, he?s just come back out and spanked the fuzz off the ball. He earns a break point when Federer sends a forehand wide. Federer serves wide and moves forward; Wawrinka just wallops a backhand pass from left to right to seal a third successive break. Federer has lost from two sets up on four occasions. He?s in serious peril of it happening for a fifth time now.

That medical timeout seems to have affected Federer more than Wawrinka, who takes a 30-0 lead with an ace out wide.

The college describes it thus: ?The OICSD advances India?s sustainable development by bringing different academic disciplines and sectors together.?It adds, ?We develop future leaders by supporting exceptional Indian scholars to study at Oxford; we carry out multidisciplinary research on sustainable nutrition, the environment and health; and we translate academic ideas to the ground.?In November 2016, the college celebrated the 150th birth anniversary  of Nashik-born Cornelia Sorabji (1866-1954), the first Indian woman student at Oxford who went on to become the first Indian woman lawyer in colonial India. ",Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's name has been removed from the Oxford India Centre for Sustainable Development which was named the Indira Gandhi Centre for Sustainable Development at its launch during the tenure of UPA government.

The cabinet cleared a decision to make drip irrigation mandatory for the water-guzzling sugarcane crop after 2019 and promote group farming by offering a subsidy to participating farmers. Maharashtra is the largest sugar producing state in the country, with farmers relying on this cash crop to bring in assured dividends. Drip irrigation is expected to increase production of sugarcane even as it conserves water. The state government has chalked a scheme with the investment of Rs200 crore to promote group farming. The government will extend the subsidy of Rs1 crore each to the farmer producer company formed under Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, by at least 20 farmers with the cluster of a minimum land of 100 acres. The government has kept the target of funding about 200 such companies. The state cabinet in its decision taken on Tuesday also decided to promote animal husbandry, fisheries and sericulture to make the group farming viable. The state government has made a budgetary allocation of Rs45 crore for immediate release of the funds for the companies.?By encouraging the group farming we are aiming to maximise the use of mechanisation by providing them ample funding for modern machinery and equipment. This will help them maximise productivity and reduce the cost of production. Once productivity is increased, the farmers can get a higher rate for their produce. We will also help the companies set up food processing units, enable them to export the products and set up mechanism for effective marketing,? said agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar.The decision was taken in the backdrop of the decline in the land holding per household to 1.44 hectares in 2010-11 from 4.28 hectares in 1970-71. The state government has announced it will make it compulsory to shift the sugarcane on drip irrigation after 2019 by launching an interest subvention scheme. The government aims to bring 3.05 lakh hectare sugarcane crop under drip irrigation in next two years in addition to the current cover of 2.25 lakh hectares. Maharashtra farmers grow sugarcane crop on 9.42 lakh hectares across the state. The government will assist the conversion with the loan of Rs 85,400 a hectare at the interest of 2% to be borne by the farmers. The remaining part of the interest rate (7.25%) will be borne by state government (4%) and sugar factories (1.25%) for the loan with the tenure of 5 years. The total estimated loan to be disbursed in two years for the scheme is Rs 2,604 crore.The state government had made it compulsory in June 2015 for sugar factories in the catchment areas of eight dams (including Tembhu, Mujla, Bhima, Kanholi Nala) to switch to drip irrigation from flood irrigation till June 2019. Based on the success of the directives, the government has decided to make it mandatory for all the sugar factories to implement the drip irrigation for sugarcane crop after June 2019.?It will be the responsibility of the sugar factories to switch to the drip irrigation. The interest subvention scheme not only enable the farmers to swtich to drip will also help them in raising production per hectare,? Fundkar said.The minister said the new scheme will replace the existing subsidy scheme which cost government about Rs350 crore a year.","The Maharashtra government on Tuesday said that it will make drip irrigation mandatory for sugarcane cultivation after 2019. For this purpose, the state will also provide a loan at an interest rate of 2% to the farmers. Drip irrigation is not only expected to raise the sugarcane production but also help in conserving water.","Maharashtra's cabinet on Tuesday cleared a decision to make drip irrigation mandatory for the water-guzzling sugarcane crop after 2019 and promoted group farming by offering a subsidy to participating farmers.

Thomas reportedly said at the forum.US Secretary of Defence James Mattis said Friday that he believes Baghdadi is still alive, following various claims in recent months that he has been killed.?We are going after him, but we assume he is alive,? the Pentagon chief said.There have been persistent rumors that Baghdadi has died in recent months.With a $25 million US bounty on his head, Baghdadi has kept a low profile but is rumored to move regularly throughout IS-held territory in Iraq and Syria.The Iraqi -- nicknamed ?The Ghost? -- has not been seen since making his only known public appearance as ?caliph? in 2014 at the Grand Mosque of Al-Nuri in Mosul, which was destroyed in the battle for Iraq?s second city.The Times has become a favorite Trump target despite his penchant for reaching out to the daily, including this week, when he gave its reporters a major interview in which he criticized his own Attorney General Jeff Sessions.In Saturday?s tweetstorm, Trump railed against The Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for its ?illegal leaks.??A new INTELLIGENCE LEAK from the Amazon Washington Post, this time against A.G. Jeff Sessions,? he wrote on Twitter, adding ?These illegal leaks... must stop!?He also groused about some of his favorite targets: the failure of US lawmakers to repeal ?dead? Obamacare, Democratic ?obstructionists? and alleged ?ties to Russia? by Hillary Clinton, his defeated opponent in last year?s presidential election.","US President Donald Trump has attacked The New York Times in a tweet, alleging that one of its reports led to the failure of a US bid to capture ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. However, US media suggested Trump was referring to a Fox News report which allegedly leaked information about US efforts to capture Baghdadi.","US President Donald Trump on Saturday attacked The New York Times and its'sick agenda', alleging that one of the paper's reports foiled a US attempt to kill Islamic State chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Hopkins also claimed that BAT Kenya had paid bribes to government officials in Burundi, Rwanda and Comoros to undermine tobacco control regulations.BAT hired the law firm Linklaters in February 2016 to conduct a ?full investigation? into the claims made by Hopkins. BAT later dropped Linklaters and appointed Slaughter and May as sole adviser on the case.Louis Charalambous, Hopkins? solicitor, said BAT had changed its tone. ?We note, with interest, that BAT have abandoned their earlier PR strategy of trying to shoot the messenger,? he said in a statement.?Paul Hopkins blew the whistle during his time at BAT and their internal team ignored him. Previously BAT tried to wriggle out by saying that Mr Hopkins had left their employ in acrimonious circumstances when, in fact, that was untrue. They also wrongly suggested that he had acted on his own, and portrayed themselves as the victims.?Now their new external law firm and revised PR strategy are silent about Mr Hopkins. They need to go further and set the record straight. The company cannot rewrite this history, and we look forward to seeing them answer these allegations in due course.?Hopkins said he had turned whistleblower at a cost to himself. ?I rejected an enhanced redundancy package designed to force me to sign a global confidentially agreement and just took statutory redundancy instead,? he said.Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of the campaigning charity Ash, said: ?At the time the allegations of fraud in Africa were first made against BAT the company accused the whistle blower of having a vendetta against the company and peddling falsehoods.?Eighteen months later and BAT is having to admit it?s under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. The SFO must leave no stone unturned.?Matthew Myers, the president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called on the US government to also investigate BAT. ?The allegations against British American Tobacco are serious and should be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,? he said.?As British American Tobacco now operates the largest publicly traded tobacco company within the United States, we urge the US Department of Justice to also investigate the company?s alleged misconduct.?The BAT chief executive, Nicandro Durante, told the Financial Times in March that the firm would ?act in a very strong way? if wrongdoing was found to have taken place. He said: ?We are in 200 countries, so I cannot give a 100% guarantee that everything?s going to go by the book.?The SFO investigation is another blow to the company, after the US health watchdog, the Food and Drug Administration, announced tighter regulations on the tobacco industry, which hit shares in tobacco firms.","UK tobacco company British American Tobacco (BAT) is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over allegations about involvement in bribery and corruption in Africa. BAT has denied allegations of a whistleblower who handed over multiple documents to SFO. However, BAT has said it is cooperating with UK authorities as campaigners are now urging US government to act.","The Serious Fraud Office has opened an investigation into allegations that British American Tobacco was involved in bribery and corruption in Africa. When Paul Hopkins handed over a large number of documents to the SFO in 2015, BAT dismissed him as a ""rogue former employee"". The SFO's inquiries have now become a formal investigation."

For every dollar earned by men in the US, Williams said, black women earn 63 cents, and 17% less than white women.Her comments come as pay gaps are examined in a range of industries after the BBC was engulfed in scandal when it published a list of its top earners in July.Williams, a 23-times grand slam winner, wrote that black women have to work eight months longer to earn the same ?as their male counterparts do in one year?, and drew on her own experiences to highlight the unfair treatment of black women in the workplace. ?I?ve been disrespected by my male colleagues and ? in the most painful times ? I?ve been the subject of racist remarks on and off the tennis court,? she wrote.Williams has repeatedly been the target of sexist and racist remarks by men in tennis. In 2016 the chief executive of the Indian Wells tennis tournament, Raymond Moore, said women?s tennis was riding on the coat-tails of the men?s tour and that female players should ?thank god? for Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. In April the Romanian team captain, Ilie Nastase, made an apparently racist comment about Williams?s unborn baby and was heard calling her and Johanna Konta ?fucking bitches?. Most recently, former champion John McEnroe said Williams would ?be, like, 700 in the world? if she played on the men?s tour. ?Luckily I am blessed with an inner drive and a support system of family and friends that encourage me to move forward. But these injustices still hurt,? Williams wrote.July 31 is Black Women's Equal Pay Day. Black women are the cornerstone of our communities, they are phenomenal, and they deserve equal pay. pic.twitter.com/XOHyIdbYPcNoting that she is ?in the rare position to be financially successful beyond my imagination?, Williams said that, if she had not been lucky enough to pick up a tennis racquet and break through, she would be like the other 24 million black women facing wage disparities in the US.?The cycles of poverty, discrimination and sexism are much, much harder to break than the record for Grand Slam titles,? she wrote. ?For every black woman that rises through the ranks to a position of power, there are too many others who are still struggling.?She said that changing the status quo would take courage to push the issue into the spotlight and force employers to compensate female employees equally: ?We deserve equal pay for our mothers, our wives, our daughters, our nieces, friends, and colleagues ? but mostly for ourselves.?Black women: be fearless. Speak out for equal pay. Every time you do, you?re making it a little easier for a woman behind you. Let?s get back those 37 cents.?Black Women?s Equal Pay Day, on 31 July, marked how long into 2017 an African American woman would have to work to be paid the same wages as her white male counterpart last year. ?Despite the large gender disadvantage faced by all women, black women were near parity with white women in 1979,? the Economic Policy Institute said. ?However in 2016, white women?s wages grew to 76% of white men?s, compared to 67% for black women relative to white men ? a racial difference of nine percentage points. The trend is going the wrong way ? progress is slowing for black women.?In the UK, research by the Fawcett Society in March revealed a similar story, that many minority ethnic women were ?left behind? by progress on the pay gap. Black African women in the UK have seen virtually no progress since the 1990s in closing the gender pay gap with white British men, with a full-time pay gap of 21.4% in the 1990s and 19.6% today. ?Black African women have been largely left behind, and in terms of closing the pay gap, Pakistani and Bangladeshi women are today only where white British women were in the 1990s,? Sam Smethers, the charity?s chief executive, said.The low number of staff from ethnic minorities on the BBC?s list of its best-paid talent has also provoked an angry response inside the corporation, after no black or ethnic minority staff featured among those earning the top 24 salaries. Williams has been a consistent advocate of equal pay. Earlier this month, when asked about what she would want for her child, she said: ?If my daughter were to play in a sport and she was able to have equal prize money, or equal pay, or equal rights, I feel like that would be a success. And if not, I would really want her to speak up for it. Any daughter of mine will have a voice.?She also praised Andy Murray after he corrected a journalist who said Sam Querrey was ?the first US player to reach a major semi-final since 2009?. Williams has joined the board of Silicon Valley firm SurveyMonkey to help tech companies diversify their workforces.","Tennis star Serena Williams wrote a personal essay in which she demanded equal pay for black women. In the essay, Williams said that for every dollar earned by men in the United States, black women earn just 63 cents. ""The cycles of poverty, discrimination and sexism are much, much harder to break than the Grand Slam titles record,"" Williams wrote.","Serena Williams has called for equal pay for black women in an essay published by Fortune to coincide with Black Women's Equal Pay Day. ""I've been disrespected by my male colleagues and?in the most painful times? I've been the subject of racist remarks on and off the tennis court,"" she wrote. Williams also said that black women have to work eight months longer to earn the same as their male counterparts."

Khaidi No 150 Cast: Chiranjeevi, Kajal Aggarwal, Tarun Arora and Brahmanandam Khaidi No 150 Director: VV VinayakKhaidi No 150 Rating: (3/5)Despite the blockbuster film that Kaththi was, Chiranjeevi has to be appreciated for choosing a remake as his comeback to films. Being at the helm of a remake is like attracting the last nail to one's own coffin as it invariably compels the audience to get into unnecessary comparisons. ALSO READ: Chiranjeevi on Khaidi No 150- I'm not nervous, but curiousALSO READ: Chiranjeevi on Naga Babu-RGV fight- I was hurt, but I didn't reactHowever, director VV Vinayak makes no mistake with Khaidi No 150. Barring a few scenes and songs, the film is a frame-by-frame rendition of the Tamil version.Much like its original, the film introduces Kaththi Seenu (Chiranjeevi), an inmate of a Kolkata prison, trying to escape from the cops. The director shows Seenu's prison number (150), pauses for a few seconds, and then reveals Megastar's face. This customary introduction scene sees a chest-thumping reception from the Telugu circuit; after all, they've been dying to see him for years.As for the plot, a petty thief Kaththi Seenu discovers his badly wounded doppelganger Shankar (also Chiranjeevi) and decides to disguise himself as the latter to escape from the Kolkata police.When the plot slowly unfolds, Seenu gets to know about Shankar, a hydrologist, who is fighting against a corporate tycoon Aggarwal (Tarun Arora). Aggarwal attempts to draw groundwater from the Neeruru village to further his business. He's also to be blamed for the many farmer suicides.After learning the actual reason behind farmer suicides, Seenu and Aggarwal face off in this commercial yet socially relevant entertainer.Apart from the mass moments in the film, what deserves a special mention is Murugadoss's writing. While rampant issues like farmer suicides barely make for front page news, films like Khaidi No 150 or Kaththi pokes the audience's conscience. Films in this genre cater to a larger sect if it manages to deliver entertainment with a veiled social angle in it. In that sense, Khaidi No 150 is a win-win, even if the film is only about half as riveting compared to Chiranjeevi's Rudraveena (1988). There's a superb portion where the director criticises the mainstream media for having failed to address issues like farmer suicide. Some of the scenes have been purposely written to target the masses.Be it dialogue delivery or dancing, Chiranjeevi gives a stellar performance in dual roles. What's amusing about the actor is that even at 61, his age is hardly visible on screen. His son and actor Ram Charan, who has also produced the film, has a guest appearance in the song Ammadu Let's Do Kummudu. It goes without saying that Chiranjeevi's forte is dance and he's flexible with moves even after all these years. Ace comedians Ali and Brahmanandam provide the comic relief in Khaidi No 150.Samantha played the female lead in the Tamil version, while Kajal Aggarwal plays the role in Telugu. Though it's almost necessary to have a heroine on board, we wonder why both the actors were cast in their respective projects.One of the highlights of both the films is the coin fight scene. But the only difference is that while Vijay beat 80 goons to a pulp in Kaththi, the number is multiplied by 10 in its Telugu version. Because, Chiranjeevi. Neil Nitin Mukesh gave a commendable performance as the antagonist in Kaththi. Unfortunately, Tarun Arora is too funny to be taken seriously here.Khaidi No 150 has music by rockstar Devi Sri Prasad. The makers have retained a lot from the Tamil version. Khaidi No 150 would have been far better had Anirudh Ravichander composed the score for the Telugu version as well. Inevitably, most of the background score brings back memories of Kaththi. Though most of the songs spoil the mood of the film, they are worth your time just because you get to watch Chiranjeevi dance.","'Khaidi No 150', which released on Wednesday, ""is more about Chiranjeevi and his return than about the story or cinema,"" wrote The New Indian Express. ""The story has it's heart in the right place,"" wrote Times of India while India Today wrote, ""Films like Khaidi No 150... poke the audience's conscience.""

Speaking at the Word To Screen, Publishers Bootcamp by Jio MAMI here, Guild president Siddharth Roy Kapur said that ?making a biopic on a political figure is radioactive right now?.Later, prodded by IANS to elaborate on the sidelines of the event, Kapur said, ?It?s unfortunately the environment that we are in at this point of time that most filmmakers are self-censoring when it comes to subjects that they pick to make a movie about because they are concerned about how it will finally be received when it goes to the CBFC for clearance. In that process, we might be really losing out on quite a few interesting stories that should be told, and I do hope that the environment changes.?Movies like Lipstick Under My Burkha and Udta Punjab ran foul of the censor board but were cleared after appeals or cuts.Kapur, former head honcho of Studios, Disney UTV, said that former actress Smriti Irani?s appointment as Cabinet Minister for Information and Broadcasting, would bring about a change for the Indian film industry which was constantly battling censorship woes. ?It?s a very positive step because she?s someone who understands the industry. I?m quite certain that we will see an easy and a more liberal view of film certification in the months to come,? Kapur said.?I believe that the (government-appointed) Shyam Benegal Committee has made some very good recommendations on what should be done as far as the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) is concerned. I do hope that?s implemented at the earliest,? added Kapur.Given that the $2 billion film industry of India, one of the largest movie-producing nations in the world, was not generating the moolah it should for a multiple of reasons -- lack of screens, slowdown in domestic theatrical revenue, steady growth in Hollywood market share and emergence of digital platforms and quality content -- Kapur sees light at the end of the tunnel.?Every industry goes through cyclical times. The cycle we are going through right now is where the economics are very challenging. Having said that, I?m quite optimistic that since we have a very strong movie-going culture, our own ethos of a star system and our own grammar of storytelling, we will come out of this,? said Kapur.?I think it?s about the industry figuring out an economic model that makes sense to everyone in the value chain rather than for a few people. And once that changes, we will see the industry do much better,? he said, adding how filmmakers need to be ?smart about their films?, release date and strategy.As for Hollywood eating into local films? business, he said, ?It?s happening and it?s definitely something to be concerned about... Because the fact is that they are making movies that are bringing people to cinemas... And that?s what we need to do too.?Exorbitant fee charged by stars can sometimes inflate a film?s budget, but breaking away from the strongly-rooted star system is going to be no answer either, said Kapur. ?I don?t think the star system will break and I don?t think it should. But I think that along with the star system, there needs to be great content that can stand on its own without any star. I have seen so many movies in the recent past that have done this and have done it very effectively,? he said.Kapur has been associated -- as producer, co-producer or associate producer -- with a mix of these -- Dangal, Kai Po Che, The Lunchbox, Raajneeti, Barfi!, Chennai Express, Shahid, Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana, A Wednesday and Paan Singh Tomar. Now he is on a new journey of his own -- that of driving his home banner Roy Kapur Films.?I?m very excited about this next phase of my career where I will be looking at all kinds of content across the board, genre-agnostic, completely. I just want to tell great stories; do some great movies that I can be proud of,? he said.His slate includes an Aamir Khan-starrer biopic on astronaut Rakesh Sharma and a biopic based on the life of a man named Vijendra Singh who had lost his wife Leela in the Uttarakhand floods.Not ready to spill more beans about any of his projects, Kapur said: ?It?s a little early to talk about any of them at this point of time.?","Producer Siddharth Roy Kapur has said making a biopic on a political figure has become radioactive nowadays.

Rodgers said. ?It appears that he was not able to get himself back around to get himself out of the situation.?Asked if Snooty had drowned, Rodgers said the manatee had been taken for a necropsy, the results of which were not yet known.

Snooty was on record as the oldest manatee in captivity, having spent 68 of his 69 years at the South Florida Museum. He was believed to be the oldest manatee in the world.Rodgers ruled out malicious or foul play in the manatee?s death, although he said the opening of the hatch remained a mystery as it was designed not to let manatees in the tank push through it. A ?Snootycam? trained on the tank was turned off at night, he said, and other security cameras could not see underwater. Snooty was discovered on Sunday morning.?We?ve been greeting people at the front door to share the heartbreaking news,? Rodgers said of a day through which the aquarium remained closed. He added that staff had helped adult visitors break the news to their children ?as they saw fit?.?Aquarium staff is heartbroken,? he said. ?We are working with them as well, with the emotional situation, they?re actively caring for the three rehab manatees today so life goes on for those manatees ? We?re just making sure our manatees and our staff are well cared for.?Snooty was born in captivity in 1948 and came to the South Florida Museum the following year. Since 1979, he has been the mascot of Manatee County. Schubick said staff were ?planning ways for the public, locally and round the world, to share their memories?.?Snooty?s very important to this community,?

In fact, it will become a leading edge practice worldwide,"" Mittal told PTI in an interview.

He, however, has said that even though telecom operators are bleeding with the entrance of a new service provider, they will need to increase investment in networks to handle competition. ""You have to accelerate market spends. You need to put more capex. We have done 85,000 base stations last year, 80,000 base stations this year. This is largest rollout anywhere in the world.

The Indian telecom czar said Bharti Airtels balancesheet remains ""healthy and strong"" and he does not think Bharti will go into losses under competitive pressure although one can ""never say never"". He maintained that with improvement in technology, the cost of network is not linear.

Mallya has been in the UK for months, escaping arrest warrants against him, while a court in London is also hearing a case regarding his return to India. Modi today met May during a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Summit here and sought UKs help in this regard. Both leaders also talked about the complete range of India-UK ties. In a tweet after the meeting, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Gopal Baglay said the Prime Minister asked for UKs ""cooperation for return of escaped Indian economic offenders"". On economic offenders issue, Baglay said, ""you have seen our tweet"". On whether cooperation from the UK was sought with just Mallya in mind, he said, ""The tweet mentions economic offenders who have escaped from India and that is the answer"". To a query on whether was Mallya in focus in terms of escaped economic offenders discussed with May, Baglay said, ""We have put out a tweet and the term used there is a plural... its English language and people who know English should understand it"". Asked whether all on the list were discussed and no specific names were mentioned, he said, ""I wont like to go into that and what we have said in the tweet is what our position is"". Baglay refused to comment directly on any question related to Mallya. Mallya, who is wanted in India for Kingfisher Airlines default on loans worth nearly Rs 9,000 crore, has been in the UK since March 2016. In April, he had attended a central London police station for his arrest and was released on conditional bail a few hours later after providing a bail bond worth 650,000 pounds, assuring the court of abiding by all conditions associated with extradition proceedings, such as surrender of his passport and a ban on him possessing any travel documents. Lalit Modi, former chief of Indian Premier League (IPL), is wanted by the Indian authorities with respect to a money laundering probe and he is said to be in the UK. The former cricket administrator has maintained that he has not done any wrong in any of the IPL deals.

This bitter truth was disclosed in an RTI response by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and 19 PSU banks. Stung by the revelation, the lawyer who had sought information under the transparency law has now moved the Competition Commission of India (CCI) alleging ""cartelisation"" and ""anti-competitive practices"" by the banks in respect of the locker service. He has informed the CCI that the RTI response from the RBI has said it has not issued any specific direction in this regard or prescribed any parameters to assess the loss suffered by a customer. Even under the RTI response, all public sectors banks have washed their hands of any responsibility. According to the information availed by the lawyer, the unanimous reason given by the 19 banks, including Bank of India, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Punjab National Bank, UCO and Canara, among others, is that ""the relationship they have with customers with regard to lockers is that of lessee (landlord) and lessor (tenant)"". The banks have contended that in such a relationship, the lessor is responsible for his or her valuables kept in the locker which is owned by the bank. Some banks, in their locker hiring agreements, have made it clear that any item stored in the locker is at the customers own risk and he or she may, in their own interest, insure the valuables. The common feature of all locker hiring agreements states, ""As per safe deposit memorandum of hiring locker, the bank will not be responsible for any loss or damage of the contents kept in the safe deposit vault as a result of any act of war or civil disorder or theft or burglary and the contents will be kept by the hirer at his or her sole risk and responsibility. ""While the bank will exercise all such normal precautions, it does not accept any liability or responsibility for any loss or damage whatsoever sustained to items deposited with it. Accordingly, hirers are advised in their own interest to insure any item of value deposited in a safe deposit locker in the bank,"" they have said. Aggrieved by the responses, the lawyer -- Kush Kalra -- raised questions before the CCI -- why not just keep the valuables at home after insuring them, instead of paying rent to the bank for a locker when it is not going to take any responsibility for the contents. He alleged that all these banks, also including State Bank of India, Indian Overseas Bank, Syndicate Bank, Allahabad Bank and others, have formed a ""cartel"" to indulge in such ""anti-competitive"" practices. He further alleged that the bank by forming an association or cartel are ""trying to limit the improvement of services which is directly affecting the competition in the market and interests of the consumer"". The lawyer has sought a probe under the Competition Act into the allegation of cartelisation by the banks in respect of the locker service.","Public sector banks cannot be held responsible in case of theft of valuables from lockers, according to an RTI response by RBI.

""We were in favour of one slab of tax, that is 18 per cent and simple compliance procedure. However, the present structure of the GST they have created, it is certainly going to be an unsuccessful enterprise,"" he told reporters here. ""Revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia is an honest man, but they are trying to implement the GST through impractical ways and with this kind of implementation, confusion will be created, which will initially give rise to inflation in the country....The GST will not be successful,"" he said. Singh was in the city after visiting Pandharpur in Solapur district in Maharashtra, where lakhs of devotees throng on the occasion of Ashadhi Ekadashi celebrated today. The former Madhya Pradesh chief minister also slammed the ruling BJP saying when it was in the opposition, the party had said that the GST will not be successful in the country, whereas it is now labelling the move as ""revolutionary"". ""Celebrations took place at midnight as if the country has got second freedom,"" Singh said. He added that the countries where the GST has become successful, have chosen a single tax slab structure. ""PM Modi is saying that it is good and simple tax, but it is not a reality. There are six slabs and petrol and liquor have been kept out of the GST and filing of tax returns have been made so complicated,"" he said. ""Previously, taxpayers used to file tax returns only four times, but now the same taxpayer will have to file tax 37 times and firms will have to appoint chartered accountants on a permanent basis,"" said Singh. ""The way demonetisation was implemented without printing of new notes, the same way they have now rolled out the GST without any preparation, as so far the returns formats are not available, there is a lack of infrastructure, such as internet connectivity, in remote areas,"" he alleged. Taking a dig at the prime minister, the Congress general secretary said, ""Modiji said that in order to eradicate black money, they have brought the GST, but alcohol which is the main source of black money, have been kept out of the GST."" Accusing the BJP and RSS for inciting violence and creating a communal rift in the society, Singh alleged that ""targeted lynching"" of Muslims is the dangerous thing for the country. ""Modi tweets over small issues, but he did not tweet about the farmers, who were killed in firing in Madhya Pradesh. We want a prime minister, who does not have 56 inch chest, but who has a 56 inch heart,"" Singh said. Talking about Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar supporting NDAs presidential nominee Ram Nath Kovind, the Congress leader said it was Kumar, who had fist pushed for the the unified oppositions candidate, although he later supported Kovind. While speaking on farmers condition in the country, Singh said demonetisation hit farmers in a big way. ""In Maharashtra, the state government announced the farm loan waiver. However, some farmers told me that the government has put a condition that farmers have to clear their outstanding loan, only after which they will get the loan waiver up to Rs 1.5 lakh,"" he said.

At the same time, they lend themselves to a nuanced and layered interpretation leading many to watch them again and again and come back and discover a new hitherto unseen aspect or a have deeper understanding and realization.One of his most memorable films, Sirivennela was a sensitive story of a blind flutist and a mute painter who fall in love with each other over the love of music and their individual setbacks.

Officials said they collected Rs20 lakh in fine from residents who failed to eliminate mosquito breeding spots in their homes. Rajan Naringrekar, insecticide officer, BMC, said the civic body focussed its efforts on finding breeding grounds of dengue carrier Aedes aegypti and malaria carrier Anopheles stephensi. From January 1 to July 15, 10, 260 breeding spots were found, of which 7,586 had larvae of Aedes aegypti and 2,674 had those of Anopheles stephensi . ?The issue is serious because a single female mosquito lays around 100-150 eggs at a time.

Naringrekar added. Data from the past two years suggested that 80% of dengue patients had breeding spots in or around their homes.Naringrekar  said since mosquitoes only breed in fresh water, people can control the spread of the disease right from their own homes. ?We have been advising residents to clean ornamental trees, feng-shui plants, bamboo plants, money plants, plates, pots, refrigerators and air-conditioners regularly to avoid dengue infection. For malaria too, people have to be cautious because the mosquito can breed wherever rainwater accumulates,? he added.","The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has claimed to have destroyed over 10,000 mosquito breeding grounds across the city in the last six months.

She asked the industry not to get panicky. ""No need to get panicky on the visa front. The lottery process is something I suppose they (the US) wanted to do a correction on. The numbers are not something they are changing... the numbers will not come down,"" Sitharaman told reporters here. Over the past few weeks, there is a growing sentiment of protectionism across various developed economies, including the US, seeking to safeguard jobs for locals and raise the bar for foreign workers. In the US, the Trump administration wants to replace the current lottery system with a more merit-based immigration policy. A mere 17 per cent of total US visas go to Indian companies and a number of American firms benefit from services provided by Indian firms, she noted. India has time and again expressed hope that the review of H-1B visa process will take into consideration the positive relationship between the two countries. Any change in visa norms can affect the movement of labour as well as spike operational costs for IT players. In response to the proposed tightening of the visa regime, Indian IT firms have been ramping up hiring of locals in the US, a market that accounts for almost 60 per cent of the Indias technology export revenues. On changes in the selection process for H-1B visa, the minister hoped that ""where the high skill set is required, they (US) would look for that, rather than for first time graduates"". The selection for such visas is getting selective, but the ""numbers are not changing"". ""No need of getting panicky... because the number of H-1B visas that we have got, we will continue to get that,"" she promised. US President Donald Trump in April had signed an executive order for tightening the H-1B visa programme to stop its ""abuse"" and ensure the visas are given to the ""most- skilled or highest paid"" petitioners, a decision that is seen to impact Indias USD 150 billion IT industry. The Indian IT industry expressed serious concern over the issue as these visas were mainly used for short-term work in the US. The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise in specialised fields. Indian technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year for their US operations. ","Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said the number of H-1B visas for Indian IT professionals will not come down. ""No need to get panicky... The lottery process is something I suppose they wanted to do a correction on,"" Sitharaman added.

In its second budget presented last year, the government said it would procure 1,000 new low floor non-AC buses, 1,000 under the cluster bus scheme and another 1,000 under a new premium category during 2016-17.However, not a single bus has been added to the low-floor fleet and only 215 have been added under the cluster scheme. The plan for premium buses did not materialise as the L-G asked the government to rework on the proposal.Data show that bus fleet has reduced by over 35% in the last six years. Delhi Transport Corporation, which used to operate 6,204 buses in 2010-11, is operating only 4,020 buses due to which ridership has also reduced considerably. Only 21.80% Delhi commutes by buses, but the share of buses among all registered vehicles in Delhi has gone down from 1.52% in 1980-81 to less than 0.36% now.

How has it been received in Pakistan?A good product is well-received everywhere. People here in Pakistan have loved the film and are ecstatic about the collaboration between the two nations.Tragically, you and Sajal Ali could not be a part of the film?s promotion and release... Tell me your honest and deepest thoughts on not being able to be in Mumbai for the opening of your film?Obviously, it is a sad feeling when you are not able to promote a project you have spent tiring days and nights working on. But then you are relieved that the promotion lies in more than capable hands, for the likes of Sridevi and Nawaazuddin Siddiqui and Akshaye Khanna.Before you, Fawad Khan and Mahira Khan could not be in India for the release of their big films. How do you look at this situation where artistes from Pakistan are being left out of their moment of glory? Is there a growing sense of resentment among Pakistani artistes for this state of isolation?I wouldn?t go as far as saying there?s resentment to this situation. But I would agree it is hurting the relations between artists of both the countries. The politics may steer a situation in any direction but the people of both countries love and respect art for what it is. They don?t see passports when they purchase a ticket, they see a film.Political relations between the two countries have deteriorated to such an extent that cultural ties are also threatened now. What do you feel about the impasse between the two countries and how it can be resolved?No matter how hard people try, our cultural ties will come out strong. We share more than just the colour of our skins, we share history, we share values, we share customs and it is just a matter of time we will start sharing our artists, directors, writers, technicians on a large scale too. I honestly believe we can find peace in art.In fact, you have produced a TV series on Hindus in Pakistan and have constantly championed India-Pakistan peace. Is that hard to do when hostility seems fashionable?No, it isn?t. As I said, people of the both countries are smart enough not get themselves into politically incorrect situations. My production of Seeta Bagri was extremely well perceived and people in Pakistan supported its message of tolerance and brotherhood.How did you decide to work in Mom? And was it difficult to shoot for the film with growing political hostilities between the two countries?Once I got the offer, I couldn?t resist myself from saying yes since, I knew, I would be playing a role against Sridevi and I was also aware that Sajal Aly from Pakistan, who is a beautiful actor, is part of the cast. The political hostility as you say did create hurdles for the film. However, it was Boney Kapoor Saab who became the leader and crisis-breaker, sorted out the production issues and took us all home for a win.Adnan Siddiqui is known for his roles on TV.You are a known face and name in India, thanks to your wonderful television serials which have amply demonstrated your range. Tell us about your experience of becoming a television star before capturing cinema?My journey in the media industry started with my modeling career and it took off with a casual role in a drama serial. People were extremely kind in accepting me as an actor when I knew nothing and since then, I am trying to prove to them, my fans, that they were right about me.Does the film industry in your country offer you enough opportunities as an actor?The New Cinema, as I like to call it, is a growing baby.

For the first time, the 30-year-old actor has openly spoken about his battle with substance abuse.

In an interview to Mumbai Mirror, the actor talked about addiction, recovery and his career. This is what he said. On addiction He has come to terms with complications of his life and has fought the demons of substance abuse. It was last year when he first talked about his drug addiction, and in the last one year, he has been a ""work in progress"". ""Addiction is not a moral failing, it does not make you a bad person even if you have made a poor choice. People still think I got hooked because it was 'cool' for a celebrity to indulge in recreational drugs. But for me, it was more of an escape from reality. My childhood was complicated and there were a lot of questions I didn't have answers to so I looked elsewhere for solace,"" said Prateik.  On acceptanceIt took him a while to understand that he was an addict, and he needed to get out of it as soon as possible. ""Acceptance and speaking up can help change the face of addiction. It educates those who are ailing and tells others that the stereotype of people suffering is the exception rather than the rule.

He wanted them to be aware of the dark truth of his life. ""I'm a fighter and criticism is not an option for me.

Contrary to what has been reported to you, this line was, in fact, drawn at a Tripartite Conference held at Simla in 1913-1914 between the Plenipotentiaries of the Governments of China, Tibet and India.

This week, the Thane district collectorate finalised land rates for farm land in Shahapur taluka, which is the highest compensation paid to farmers in Maharashtra for a  public project,so far. Farmers from Khardi village in Shahapur taluka stand to get Rs 2.43 crore for an acre of land under this project.  The ready reckoner rate for this village for every hectare of land is around Rs29.59 lakh ( Around 2.4 acres make one hectare of land).The compensation for the 23 villages in this taluka, which will lose land to the 706-km highway, ranges from Rs52.16 lakh to Rs5.84 crore for an hectare for land. This works out to Rs21.66 lakh to Rs2.43 crore for an acre of land.  A copy of the land rates announced for every village per hectare is with HT. After Khardi, farmers from villages like Dalkhan, Birwadi and Kasara will get a generous compensation of around Rs74.84 lakh and Rs68.93 lakh for an acre of land. This is a one-time compensation that will be paid to farmers if they opt for direct settlement with the state government. Read:?Congress and Shiv Sena up the ante against Maharashtra government for blanket loan waiverGiven the wide range, however, not all farmers will be happy with the rates announced. So far, the compensation given to farmers for the Shendre-Bidkin industrial park near Aurangabad under the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor for nearly Rs23 lakh an acre was being considered as one of highest payouts for farm land. (In the case of DMIC, however, separate compensation was also given for orchards).Thane district collector Dr Mahendra Kalyankar confirmed the final land rates for farm land in Shahapur taluka.?We are trying to offer the highest land rate possible for every district affected by the project. It?s history in making,?? said chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.The compensation for non-agriculture land in Shahapur taluka is even higher, in some cases as high as Rs12.60 crore to Rs18.11 crore for an acre of such land in Khardi and Kasara villages. However, only 10 to 15% of non-agricultural land comes under the highway, with officials claiming these rates could get revised as they seemed exorbitant. The proposed eight-lane highway, which will run across 10 districts to link Nagpur to Thane, is facing stiff opposition from farmers over land acquisition. In a bid to tone down these protests, the government is offering competitive land rates to woo the farmers. The land rates are being worked out by committees appointed for every district led by the collector that considers a variety of parameters including ready reckoner rate of every village, average of last three years of sale deeds, the number of land transactions, compensation as per Land Acquisition law etc, 25 per cent more incentive offered by the state for direct sale.Read: Maharashtra farmer complains against IMD for ?wrong? rain forecastLast week, Nasik district collector had announced land rates for the district in the range of Rs40 lakh to Rs80 lakh for one hectare of land. But this had only intensified protests against the project with farmers from Nasik, not wooed by the compensation offered for their irrigated lands.?We have considered a variety of factors and the rates get jacked up also by the number of land transactions that have taken place in that village. In Khardi, for instance, in the recent past, we noted nearly 500 land sale deeds. This was comparatively far less in Chande village that has among the lowest compensations in Shahapur,?? said a Thane district collectorate official.The Thane collectorate has also worked out rates for Kalyan taluka, which are far lower than Shahapur, with the highest compensation being Rs1.50 crore for an hectare of land or Rs62 lakh for an acre of land. The lowest compensation here is around Rs61.14 lakh for an hectare of land or Rs25.47 lakh for an acre of land.The district administration may revise the land rates for Kalyan taluka given that farmers are likely to react negatively given the high rates offered  in neighbouring Shahapur taluka.","The farmers in Khardi village in Thane will get a compensation of ?2.43 crore per acre from the Maharashtra government, for their land acquired for the Mumbai-Nagpur super communication highway project.

It proved very popular when it opened this month and was hailed by the Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, as the beginning of a ?dream? to launch open swimming areas in other city waterways, including on the river Seine in 2024 if Paris succeeds in its bid to host the Olympics that year.The swimming area was briefly closed on Monday after a routine test on Sunday night found higher than normal levels of enterococci, bacteria found in faecal matter. The city of Paris tweeted that the pool was closed because the water quality was ?unsatisfactory?.The pool reopened on Tuesday morning after subsequent tests found the water quality was back to normal. It is thought that heavy rainfall at the weekend had led to the higher than normal readings of bacteria levels.Tests are regularly made at a point upstream from the swimming area to ensure the water quality is within guidelines. After a 10-year effort by the city to clean up the canal water, regular tests had consistently come back with satisfactory results showing the bacteria levels were far below accepted limits. Authorities said they would keep testing regularly during the swimming season.A spokeswoman for the Paris authorities said: ?Tests carried out on Monday night showed that the levels are now back in line with the requirements, so we have reopened the pool. It?s nothing serious. The water quality is good.?The floating pool structure, which can take up to 300 swimmers at a time, proved an instant hit after opening this month, and when Paris temperatures rose well above 30C, hundreds of people queued each day to get in.Inaugurating the facility, Hidalgo called it ?a dream come true?. The mayor has set a target of 2024, when the city hopes to host the summer Olympics, to have swimming areas at designated points along the Seine.After decades in which casual bathing in Paris?s river and canals was banned for many reasons, including strong currents, fears of bacteria and sewage pollution, authorities are moving to give swimmers more access.In recent years, lone swimmers could regularly be seen taking dips in the canal at La Villette of their own accord, despite the ?no swimming? signs.The official pool structure, opened by city hall at La Villette for the summer as part of the Paris Plages festival, marks the first time in many years that swimmers can legally swim there.","The Paris canal opened to swimmers after nearly a century was temporarily closed within a week due to pollution and ""unsatisfactory"" water quality.
